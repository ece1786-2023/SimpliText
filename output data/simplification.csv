"Managing down operating costs within such a complex technology environment is extremely difficult. Retiring applications that are tightly coupled within the technical and data architecture results in nearly insurmountable dependency management issues and change risk. Seemingly small projects quickly become big, expensive efforts with extended timeframes. Retiring one application inevitably requires upstream and downstream changes and this added cost erodes the business case and often leads to a decision to leave things as they are.","Cutting costs in a complicated tech system is tough because of how closely connected the parts are. What seems like a small change can quickly grow into a big and costly project, using up a lot of time and materials. Turning off one program can set off a chain reaction that requires more changes, leading to such steep expenses that keeping things as they are often turns out to be the smarter choice."
"In this editorial for the collection on complexity in mental health research, we introduce and summarize the inaugural contributions to this collection: a series of theoretical, methodological, and empirical papers that aim to chart a path forward for investigating mental health in all its complexity... From physics to ecology, there is a rapidly evolving body of interdisciplinary research dedicated to investigating complex systems.","The opening section of the research group focused on psychological health emphasizes how intricate the subject is and gives a brief overview of the first papers. These papers cover a wide range of research activities committed to examining mental health thoroughly. They show the quick growth of studies on complicated systems, which are becoming more popular in areas like the science of materials and the study of living organisms, such as the relationships between living things and their environments."
"Throughout the twentieth century, much of psychiatry aspired to reductionist simplicity... However, far from uncovering simple etiologies, the past century of psychiatric research has revealed systematic complexity, leading to a growing recognition that mental disorders are dauntingly complex phenomena.","In the early 1900s, scientists looked for simple reasons for mental health issues. But they quickly found out that mental health disorders are complicated, and our understanding of their many details keeps increasing."
Impulses travel along nerves at a speed called the nerve conduction velocity (NCV). This velocity has been extensively measured in human peripheral nerves because of its utility in clinical medicine. Appreciably decreased NCV can be an important indicator of nerve injury or disease,"The speed at which messages travel through your nerves is the measure of how fast these messages, which are like tiny bursts of electricity, move. Doctors often check this speed to keep an eye on the health of your nerves. If this speed is much slower than usual, it can show that there might be some harm to the nerves or problems with the brain and nervous system."
"Social isolation also comes with significant risk of mental health and neuropsychiatric disorders, including chronic anxiety and depression. Alongside this complex aetiology, social isolation has been linked to the increased prevalence of substance use disorders across a range of drug types, where social isolation both predicts drug abuse, and drug abuse occurs as a consequence of social isolation. Unfortunately, when socially isolated individuals wish to moderate or quit drug-intake, quitting is more difficult and less successful, limiting the likelihood of a long lasting recovery","Spending too much time by yourself can harm your emotional well-being, leading to feelings of worry or intense unhappiness. Being alone too much can make the risk of using drugs in harmful ways worse, which may come from or make the feeling of being alone even stronger. Sadly, people who are alone and fighting with a drug habit have a harder time stopping the use of drugs and keeping a clear head."
"The mobile nature of digital games ensures that the lines between in-school and out-of-school gameplay is blurred. Thus, it is important to explore the possibilities of these games to create new spaces for learning and engaging with mathematics. From a social learning perspective, research has been concerned with the ways in which the games industry has been influencing ‘interactive’ learning via computers; creating spaces for students to create their own digital games in order to teach concepts to peers; or the ways in which the games are arranged to motivate learners to engage with the games and engage with higher-order problem solving abilities.","Digital games mix learning and play because they can be used both in school and at home. This combination offers a chance to investigate how they can improve math education. Experts are studying how these games encourage hands-on learning experiences, give students the ability to make their own learning games, and spark excitement for tackling tough problems."
"Fritz et al. implement one of the suggestions by Ioannidis et al., using network analysis to study interrelations among psychological and environmental resilience factors for mental health, such as family support and self-esteem, in adolescents with and without child adversity","Fritz and his workmates considered the suggestions from Ioannidis and his group, thoroughly examining the effects of elements like family backing and self-assurance on the psychological health of young individuals. They concentrated their study on the differences in psychological wellness between young people who have faced early life difficulties and those who haven't."
"Mental disorders arise from a host of components across biological, psychological, and social levels of analysis, intertwined in a web of complex interactions... We must go further and understand both the individual components and the complex interactions among them","Understanding mental health issues involves looking closely at how physical, emotional, and social aspects interact with each other. Every part must be carefully studied to understand how they affect each other and play a role in these health situations."
"Ethical considerations are crucial in AI and ML, as their usage presents significant concerns around privacy, accountability, and command. The potential for algorithms to perpetuate existing biases, responsibility for AI-generated decisions, and the misuse of AI and ML for malicious purposes like cyberattacks and misinformation are key ethical concerns","The moral problems linked to AI and learning through computers are very important because of serious worries about keeping personal information safe, making sure people answer for their actions, and managing control. These technologies risk keeping ongoing unfair preferences alive, make it harder to figure out who is responsible for AI's choices, and create chances for wrong use, like breaking into systems and spreading false information, leading to deep ethical difficulties."
"In his numerous writings, Marx critiques capitalism by identifying its flaws... Only once the working class realizes the flaws of the system, Marx believes, will they - must they - rise up against their bourgeois masters and achieve the necessary and inevitable communist revolution.","Marx points out the mistakes of a business system focused on making money in his writings. He thinks that, after a while, employees will notice these issues and rise up against their rich bosses. This rebellion, he expects, will clear the path for a new society where the group as a whole shares ownership of property."
"To get a better idea of how lice evolved and spread, a team led by marine biologist Marina S. Ascunce of the University of Florida in Gainesville sequenced the genomes of 463 head lice collected from 38 countries. The researchers found that human head lice belong to two genetically distinct clades, or groups, both of which hitched rides to the Americas on humans.","Marina S. Ascunce and her group from the University of Florida carried out research on head lice by examining the genetic material from 463 examples gathered from 38 different countries. They discovered that head lice can be sorted into two separate genetic categories, both of which were brought to North and South America due to people moving from different places."
"For the last 10 years, the 'Convention of States' movement has sought to remake the Constitution and force a tea party vision of the framers’ intent upon America. This group wants to wholesale rewrite wide swaths of the U.S. Constitution in one fell swoop. In the process, they hope to do away with regulatory agencies like the FDA and the CDC, virtually eliminate the federal government’s ability to borrow money, and empower state legislatures to override federal law.","For the past decade, the 'Convention of States' group has been working hard to change the Constitution in a way that matches up well with what the founding fathers originally wanted. They have a big goal to completely redo the Constitution in a broad way, focusing on getting rid of federal organizations such as the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They also want to greatly cut down on how much the federal government can borrow money and give state law-making bodies the power to say no to federal laws."
"Surgeons have given a man suffering from a debilitating lung condition a new lease of life by using breast implants in an unprecedented procedure. After Davey Bauer from Missouri caught the flu a few months ago, he developed a lung infection that was resistant to antibiotics.","In the state of Missouri, a person named Davey Bauer had a special operation because of a serious problem with his lungs that came from being sick after catching the flu. When medicine to fight infections didn't fix his health problem, medical professionals chose to put special devices in his chest to aid in his healing."
"A long-beaked echidna, named after David Attenborough and thought to be extinct, has been rediscovered in the mountains of Indonesia. The long-lost species of mammal is described as having the spines of a hedgehog, the snout of an anteater and the feet of a mole.","A one-of-a-kind animal with sharp, needle-like projections, thought to have disappeared, has been found again in the mountains of Indonesia. This uncommon animal, named to pay tribute to the respected wildlife expert David Attenborough, is recognized by its long nose, its back covered with hedgehog-like sharp projections, a nose similar to that of an anteater, and feet resembling those of a mole."
"The emergence of miniature and micro-products and components is increasingly demanding the production of parts with dimensions in the range of a few tens of nanometers to a few millimeters. Micro-/nano-cutting is one of the key technologies to enable the realization of micro-products, while a great many micro-manufacturing processes have been developed.","As the need for parts as tiny as tens of one-billionth to a few one-thousandth of a meter increases, creating technologies that can make very small and accurate cuts has become crucial. Therefore, different techniques have been created to produce these tiny parts on a limited scale."
"Within this structuralist, defense-in-depth approach, safety margins against these scenarios are enforced through conservative regulations of system design and operation, under the creed that the identified worst-case, credible accidents would envelope all credible accidents for what regards the challenges and stresses posed on the system and its protections. The underlying principle has been that if a system is designed to withstand all the worst-case credible accidents, then it is ‘by definition’ protected against any credible accident","To protect a system well, it's necessary to set it up and run it following firm guidelines that can hold up against the most severe accidents. The basic idea is that getting ready for the worst possible situations makes sure the system can bounce back from any unexpected problems."
"A constant failure rate (CFR) is indicative of externally induced failures, as in the constant hazard rate situation for non-repairable items. A CFR is also typical of complex systems subject to repair and overhaul, where different parts exhibit different patterns of failure with time and parts have different ages since repair or replacement. Repairable systems can show a decreasing failure rate (DFR) when reliability is improved by progressive repair, as defective parts which fail relatively early are replaced by good parts. ‘Burn in’ is applied to electronic systems, as well as to parts, for this purpose.","Systems or items often break down due to outside factors and this happens a lot with items that can't be fixed or complicated systems that need regular upkeep, where parts get used up and have to be swapped out or looked after from time to time. On the other hand, systems that can be fixed might have fewer breakdowns if making them better includes putting in better parts instead of broken ones, making the system more dependable as a whole. The ""burn in"" method is especially used with electronic systems and parts to make them more likely to work well."
"It should be noted that, although the system engineering process is applicable in all phases of the life cycle, this is not to imply that any single organizational entity within a given project is responsible for the completion of all of the tasks necessary to accomplish these objectives. The process must be an “inherent” element within any given program structure, and the successful fulfillment of such objectives is dependent on many different organizational groups, working in a cooperative and integrated manner.","Creating and building a system is an essential part during the entire life of a product, smoothly fitting into the program's usual activities. This process isn't just up to one team; it requires joint work from different groups to meet the goals effectively."
"Thompson and Zhi acknowledge that the AI models are only as good as the data on which they’re trained. There is a lack of racial and geographical diversity in individuals who have had their brains scanned and genomes sequenced, especially in databases such as the UK Biobank, so the findings from this AI-guided research might not be applicable to everyone. Furthermore, Goate says it will be crucial to show that the AI models’ performance can be replicated in other databases, and that they show consistent results.","Thompson and Zhi have discovered a solid connection between how well AI systems work and how good the information they learn from is. They highlight that not having a wide range of brain pictures and genetic designs, particularly from the UK's collection of biological samples that doesn't include people from different racial backgrounds and areas, might restrict the worldwide relevance of AI research results. Moreover, Goate emphasizes the need for AI systems to produce reliable and credible results across different collections of data."
"Now recall that the underlying LLM’s task, given the dialogue prompt followed by a piece of user-supplied text, is to generate a continuation that conforms to the distribution of the training data, which are the vast corpus of human-generated text on the Internet. What will such a continuation look like? If the model has generalized well from the training data, the most plausible continuation will be a response to the user that conforms to the expectations we would have of someone who fits the description in the preamble. In other words, the dialogue agent will do its best to role-play the character of a dialogue agent as portrayed in the dialogue prompt.","The program that's set up to run on its own mainly has the job of creating replies that look like they're from a person, using the huge collection of text it has learned from. It starts doing this when it gets a signal and some information from the person using it. If taught well, the program's replies will look very much like what a person would say, given the situation that comes from the first information the person using it gives. In its core, the program tries to copy the character it has been told to make again."
"Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas. Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.","In 2006, Hamas won the Palestinian elections and then took over the Gaza Strip from Fatah, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, in 2007. This change in who was in charge led to many violent fights between Gaza fighters and Israeli soldiers. To stop Hamas and prevent attacks, like rocket launches aimed at Israeli towns, Israel and Egypt have set up a blockade around Gaza. The residents of Gaza argue that the harsh limits and Israeli attacks in areas with a lot of people are a form of punishment for everyone."
"If being a spokesman for a generation is a fleeting occupation, being a symbol of an era is downright dangerous for anyone who has the bad luck to outlive it. In the next few years the expatriate Fitzgerald continued to publish stories about flappers and giddy undergraduates in the Saturday Evening Post even as he struggled with alcohol and Zelda's increasingly unstable mental state. Travelling with Zelda in North Africa in 1930, he wrote about hearing ""a dull distant crash which echoed to the farthest wastes of the desert"".","Being the spokesperson for a group of young people is a short-lived role, and it gets even riskier when you're viewed as a symbol of a specific time, especially when you survive beyond that time. Scott Fitzgerald, who lived abroad for a while, kept writing stories about young people for the Saturday Evening Post while dealing with his own struggles with drinking too much and his wife Zelda's worsening mental health. In 1930, while in North Africa with Zelda, he told a story about a gentle, echoing noise that spread across the desert dunes."
"This despite the fact that I can say (like everyone else on Harvard’s campus in the fall of 2003) that “I was there” at Facebook’s inception, and remember Facemash and the fuss it caused; also that tiny, exquisite movie star trailed by fan-boys through the snow wherever she went, and the awful snow itself, turning your toes gray, destroying your spirit, bringing a bloodless end to a squirrel on my block: frozen, inanimate, perfect—like the Blaschka glass flowers. Doubtless years from now I will misremember my closeness to Zuckerberg, in the same spirit that everyone in ’60s Liverpool met John Lennon.","During my time at the university in the fall of 2003, I saw the start of Facebook and the debates around Facemash. I met a famous actress who had a group of fans following her and felt the severe chill that made a squirrel stop moving. Even though I was near where Facebook started, I might be inclined to exaggerate my link to Mark Zuckerberg in the future, just like how many people brag about their claimed connections to John Lennon in Liverpool during the 1960s."
"Rakesh Khurana has amply shown how this delusion of the charismatic savior creates a dysfunctional market for CEOs, allowing the small number of existing public-company CEOs to demand and receive extravagant compensation. The myth of the generalist CEO is bolstered by the many fawning media portrayals where CEOs say that their key jobs are understanding, hiring, and motivating people—leading board members to believe that you can run a technology company without knowing anything about technology.","Rakesh Khurana has demonstrated how the false belief in the outstanding and brave company leader supports a mistaken system that permits a small group of top company leaders to ask for and get excessively high pay. This incorrect idea is strengthened by stories in the news that praise these leaders and highlight their people skills, convincing board members that specific expertise isn't essential to manage a tech company."
"At first, it’s a solipsistic fantasy—the secret sharer you can tell your troubles to, or that only you understand. Later, it’s rooted in a more philosophical curiosity, the longing to experience the ineffable interiority of some very different being. My eight-year-old daughter says that she wishes the horses she rides could talk, just so she could ask them what it feels like to be a horse. Such a desire presumes—as Thomas Nagel put it in his 1974 essay “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?”—that animals have some kind of subjectivity, and that it might somehow be plumbed. ","The adventure begins as a private dream, a place to share hidden thoughts or create a special connection with another creature. This intense interest develops into a deep desire to learn about the life of a different kind of animal. My eight-year-old daughter, for instance, is attracted to interacting with horses, motivated by her wish to understand their lives. Her powerful longing reflects the ideas of thinker Thomas Nagel, who suggested that animals have a different perspective that people might be able to understand in concept."
"I dare say, to deciphering the enigma behind the obsessive, pitch-black fiction. Joseph Heller, the opposite of demonstrative, was given to oblique ways of showing affection….  That was the year Heller published his second novel, “Something Happened,” which Daugherty commends as follows: “Joe stepped beyond Wilson’s sentimentality and Yates’s bitterness to eviscerate modern America’s success ethic.” ","Joseph Heller had a special way of creating made-up stories that explored complex and deep topics. He was a quiet person who didn't show his feelings openly, but he shared his friendliness in a gentle way. When his second book, ""Something Happened,"" came out, he was praised by Daugherty for going beyond the emotional complexity of authors like Wilson and the sharp observations of Yates, providing a sharp evaluation of the American pursuit of success."
"At a certain point, though—to say exactly when would ruin a fairly stunning surprise—the cat-and-mouse psychology is jettisoned in favor of something more procedural. The two halves of “Love Crime” divide according to the words of the title: the first explores the knotty, feverish, ambiguous bond between Christine and Isabelle, while the second is all about guilt, innocence, evidence and motive. It is interesting and ingenious, even if some of the kinky, queasy fascination that had been so intoxicating in the earlier scenes ebbs away.","The movie ""Love Crime"" changes from a mind-related game to a well-organized story while keeping its ability to capture interest. At first, it looks deeply into the complex interactions between Christine and Isabelle, and later it investigates topics of responsibility, purity, and reasons for actions. Even though it's smart, the film's early feeling of thrill lessens as the plot moves forward."
"If Dickens’s prose fiction has “defects”—excesses of melodrama, sentimentality, contrived plots, and manufactured happy endings—these are the defects of his era, which for all his greatness Dickens had not the rebellious spirit to resist; he was at heart a crowd-pleaser, a theatrical entertainer, with no interest in subverting the conventions of the novel as his great successors D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf would have; nor did he contemplate the subtle and ironic counterminings of human relations in the way of George Eliot and Thomas Hardy, who brought to the English novel an element of nuanced psychological realism not previously explored.","Charles Dickens, a much-loved writer, frequently held onto the emotional and overly dramatic habits of his time, leading to storylines and endings that you could often see coming. He liked to stick to the usual ways of telling stories of his period, aiming to satisfy his readers rather than completely change how novels were written, in contrast to those who followed him like D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf. Moreover, Dickens did not explore the complex and subtle aspects of how people interact with the mental understanding that his peers like George Eliot and Thomas Hardy introduced to writing."
"F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby by no means serves as a blanket condemnation of the American dream; instead, the author uses the novel and its upwardly mobile protagonist to celebrate the ability of those not born of wealth to rise to the pinnacle of American society while also examining the costs that can accompany such success. When this duality is understood, the book’s descriptions of the glittering banality of the upper-class lifestyle can be seen as a critique of the hollowness of strictly material success, rather than simply demonstrating that Fitzgerald possessed, as Trilling described it, “a taste for aristocracy.”","F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"" carefully examines the attraction of the American dream, showing its potential to change an unknown person into a success story. However, Fitzgerald also reveals the negative sides of this dream, in the end criticizing the emptiness that comes with just being rich. This review goes against Lionel Trilling's idea that Fitzgerald supported the rich and their goals."
"For instance, when provided with a pollen-generating food source, bees will develop the capacity to feed on pollen, known as pollinivory; this finding does help to explain the explosion in bee species some 120 million years ago. The study also validates the theory that bees evolved from a species of carnivorous wasps. While pollinivory was confirmed as an important step in the process of bee speciation, the study overturned the previous hypothesis that this factor by itself was the cause of the diversification of bee species.","Research shows that bees came from meat-eating wasps and began to do well around 120 million years ago when they started eating pollen from flowers. However, the study also points out that the growth in different kinds of bees wasn't just because of their new pollen-based food; other elements also played a part in their rise in diversity."
"Though volcanic eruptions emit carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, the atmospheric concentration of this gas is about 16000 times the amount released by volcanic eruptions; therefore, no matter how large a volcanic eruption is, it cannot produce a significant change in the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Further, the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted per year by volcanic eruptions – between 130 and 230 million tons – is roughly equivalent to that emitted in only three to five days of human activity.","Volcanoes release carbon dioxide, but their addition is quite small when compared to the current levels of this gas in the atmosphere, showing that they don't greatly change the total amount of this gas. Indeed, the yearly release of carbon dioxide from all the world's volcanoes put together is the same as the amount made by human actions in just three to five days."
"Most of Werner's metaphorical moments were painterly - the juxtaposing of the wild bird and the tame tree, the shimmer of the periwinkle, the splurt of titanium white that fell from it onto the pavement. He loved New York for its simple surprises, although in truth, Oregon and Iowa and Arizona and everywhere else had simple surprises as well. Cantaloupe-colored sunrises, banded cows, Dairy Queens, all kinds of things that didn't include black plastic mountains of trash and the smell of dog urine.","Werner had his own way of seeing things, often comparing a relaxed bird to a calm tree and enjoying the gentle sparkle of light blue colors mixed with the random spread of white across the land. He took great joy in the unexpected delights of New York but also knew that states like Oregon, Iowa, and Arizona had their own attractive features. These included lively sunrises and cows with unique markings to charming, old-fashioned ice cream shops, which stood out sharply against the less pleasant views and smells of the city environment."
"The Times, in a welcome but highly uncharacteristic embrace of anarchy, celebrated this development as an ingenious guerrilla tactic in youth's eternal war against adult authority-""a bit of techno-jujitsu,"" as the paper put it. But it's not entirely clear which side is the winner here. When you hear the tone, it apparently sets your teeth on edge, which means that, if the entire class suddenly grimaces, it's a good bet that one of the students just got a text message.","The newspaper praised the young people's act of defiance, comparing it to ""digital fighting techniques"" in their continuing struggle with grown-ups, even though the winner is still not clear. The annoying noise can make a whole room of students jerk or react at the same time, which often suggests that a student has received a text message."
"And finally, for most Americans, the War of Imagination - built of nationalistic excitement and ideological hubris and administration pronouncements about ""spreading democracy"" and ""greetings with sweets and flowers,"" and then about ""dead-enders"" and ""turning points,"" and finally about ""staying the course"" and refusing to ""cut and run"" -began, under the pressure of nearly three thousand American dead and perhaps a hundred thousand or more dead Iraqis, to give way to grim reality.","As time passed, the joy and happiness that many people from the United States felt at first started to lessen. The government's claims about encouraging a system of government where people choose their leaders and defeating enemies faded as the harsh truth became clear: almost 3,000 lives from the United States had been taken, and the number of deaths in Iraq could have exceeded 100,000."
"In the last hundred years intellectual advances of science and politics have in like fashion been crystallized into material of instruction and now resist further change. I would not say that the spirit of teaching is hostile to that of liberal inquiry, but a philosophy which exists largely as something to be taught rather than wholly as something to be reflected upon is conducive to discussion of views held by others rather than to immediate response. Philosophy when taught inevitably magnifies the history of past thought, and leads professional philosophers to approach their subject-matter through its formulation in received systems. ","Over the past hundred years, the method of instructing science and government has turned very rigid, concentrating more on what is already known rather than encouraging new ideas. Education isn't against profound thinking, but the manner in which philosophical thinking is instructed often emphasizes the growth of old ideas, causing students to rely on traditional ways of thinking instead of inventing fresh ones."
"It was the preliminary dwarfing and deliquescence of the mature old beside the embryonic mass of the new. It was impossible then—it is, I believe, only beginning to be possible now—to estimate the proportions, possibilities, and inter-relations of the new social orders out of which a social organization has still to be built in the coming years. No formula of definite reconstruction had been evolved, or has even been evolved yet, after a hundred years.","As old parts of society slowly disappeared with the arrival of new parts, it became hard to understand the size, possibilities, and connections of the new social systems that were starting to appear and would form our future. A hundred years later, we still don't have a clear plan for rebuilding."
"We are never so apt to lose our sense of proportion as when we consider those beloved writers whom we hold to be humourists because they have made us laugh. It may be conceded that, as a people, we have an abiding and somewhat disquieting sense of fun. We are nimble of speech, we are more prone to levity than to seriousness, we are able to recognize a vital truth when it is presented to us under the familiar aspect of a jest, and we habitually allow ourselves certain forms of exaggeration, accepting, perhaps unconsciously, Hazlitt's verdict: ""Lying is a species of wit, and shows spirit and invention.""","We often ignore the intricacy of writers who please us with funny stories because the happiness of laughing pulls us towards light-hearted conversation rather than deep discussions. Comedy makes it simpler to understand deep ideas, and we usually concur with Hazlitt's idea that there's a special talent in making truth more attractive by decorating it with amusing aspects."
"The stage in these volumes presents itself indeed not merely as a mirror of life, but as an illustration of the utmost intensity of life, in the fortunes and characters of the players. Ups and downs, generosity, dark fates, the most delicate goodness, have nowhere been more prominent than in the private existence of those devoted to the public mimicry of men and women. Contact with the stage, almost throughout its history, presents itself as a kind of touchstone, to bring out the bizarrerie, the theatrical tricks and contrasts, of the actual world.","Theater makes real life more dramatic by increasing the intensity of feelings, good actions, sad outcomes, and praiseworthy characteristics of performers. Their jobs display these features more clearly than most, and the long-standing practice of theater emphasizes the natural qualities and strong battles that are mixed into daily life."
"It is this salutary organ of the will of all which establishes, in civil right, the natural equality between men. It is this celestial voice which dictates to each citizen the precepts of public reason, and teaches him to act according to the rules of his own judgment, and not to behave inconsistently with himself. It is with this voice alone that political rulers should speak when they command; for no sooner does one man, setting aside the law, claim to subject another to his private will, than he departs from the state of civil society, and confronts him face to face in the pure state of nature, in which obedience is prescribed solely by necessity.","Our will firmly supports fairness under the law, which promotes fair and steady thinking and behavior. Public officials should stick to this ethical guide when deciding. However, if someone ignores the law and tries to control others for their own benefit, they leave behind the basic principles of a well-behaved society and fall back to a basic state where power is the only ruler."
"Evolutionary psychology takes as its starting point the uncontroversial assertion that the anatomical and physiological features of the human brain have arisen as a result of adaptations to the demands of the environment over the millennia. However, from this reasonable point of departure, these psychologists make unreasonable extrapolations. They claim that the behavior of contemporary man (in almost all its aspects) is a reflection of features of the brain that acquired their present characteristics during those earliest days of our species when early man struggled to survive and multiply.","The study of how the mind has changed and developed over thousands of years is based on the idea that the human brain has changed to deal with the difficulties that the natural world has presented over a very long time. While this idea is broadly agreed upon, some experts in the study of the mind sometimes stretch its use too far. They claim that nearly every part of modern human actions can be connected to changes that happened a long time ago when staying alive and having offspring were the main goals."
"In regard to propaganda the early advocates of universal literacy and a free press envisaged only two possibilities: the propaganda might be true, or it might be false. They did not foresee what in fact has happened, above all in our Western capitalist democracies - the development of a vast mass communications industry, concerned in the main neither with the true nor the false, but with the unreal, the more or less totally irrelevant. In a word, they failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions.","The early trailblazers who supported the idea of education for everyone and a press without restrictions considered propaganda to be an issue of truth or lies. They did not predict the rise of a huge industry of news and fun activities in Western business-focused societies, which often puts less important or made-up stories ahead of the complete truth or falsehoods. These initial supporters also did not fully recognize the strong desire of the public for things that amuse and interest them."
"There must therefore be an intrinsic connection between the conditions and the structural adaptations of the organism, and, since the conditions of life cannot be determined by the animal itself, the adaptations must be called forth by the conditions. The selection theory teaches us how this is conceivable, since it enables us to understand that there is a continual production of what is non-purposive as well as of what is purposive, but the purposive alone survives, while the non-purposive perishes in the very act of arising. This is the old wisdom taught long ago by Empedocles.","Living things must change to fit their surroundings to stay alive because they can't control their situations. This process of change keeps helpful characteristics and gets rid of ones that don't help, an idea that goes back to the old lessons of Empedocles, who understood how significant these shifts are in the natural world."
"As their name suggests, rare collectibles are scarce, hard to find items. They can be antiques that are desirable because of their age, type of craftsmanship or some other unique feature that represents the past. Some rare collectibles are so old that they are considered to be antiquities - artifacts of an ancient civilization such as ancient Greek or ancient Chinese society. Alternatively, rare collectibles can be of very recent origin, sometimes being only a few years old. The common denominator of all rare collectibles, no matter what their type or age, is rarity. Frequently, because of their scarcity and their appeal, rare collectibles are also valuable. ","Items that are hard to find, such as costly old objects and modern items made in small numbers, are in demand because they are rare. Whether the items are old relics or just-released unique versions, this lack of availability is usually what makes them wanted and valuable."
"Therefore, though the situation seems dark in the context of the confrontation between the superpowers, the silver lining is provided by amazing phenomenon that the very nations which have spent incalculable resources and energy for the production of deadly weapons are desperately trying to find out how they might never be used. They threaten each other, intimidate each other and go to the brink, but before the total hour arrives they withdraw from the brink.","The stressful situation among strong countries is worrying, but there is hope because they work hard to keep their large collections of weapons unutilized. They participate in a risky strategy of pushing each other to the edge, testing each other's boundaries, but they regularly succeed in steering clear of disaster."
"Irrespective of how small these differences might be, they are crucial, and the disequilibrium is maintained by air near the surface mixing with air higher up, which is typically appreciably cooler and lower in water vapor content. The turbulence, which takes its energy from the wind mixes the air. As the speed of wind increases, so does the turbulence, and consequently the rate of heat and moisture transfer. We can arrive at a detailed understanding of this phenomenon after further study. The transfer of momentum from wind to water, which occurs when waves are formed is an interacting-and complicated phenomenon.","The slight variations are very important in keeping the irregularity in the air around us by combining the warmer air close to the ground with the colder, less humid air higher up. This combination is pushed by air flows that create rough, spinning shapes, improving the swapping of warmth and water content. More study in this field will give us a better grasp of the complex relationship where air motion moves energy to water, leading to the creation of waves."
"The interconnectedness of brain and body has tantalizing implications for our ability to both understand and treat illness. If some brain conditions start outside the brain, then perhaps therapies for them could also reach in from outside. Treatments that take effect through the digestive system, heart or other organs, for instance, would be much easier and less invasive to administer than those that must cross the blood–brain barrier, the brain’s first line of defence against pathogens and other insults from the body.","Understanding how the brain and body are linked is very important for dealing with illnesses, as it points out that some brain problems might start in other parts of the body. This introduces the chance of treatments from outside the body focusing on places like the belly or heart, providing alternatives that are less forceful than those that have to break through the brain's protection against sickness and harm."
"The French are certainly misunderstood: — but whether the fault is theirs, in not sufficiently explaining themselves, or speaking with that exact limitation and precision which one would expect on a point of such importance, and which, moreover, is so likely to be contested by us — or whether the fault may not be altogether on our side, in not understanding their language always so critically as to know “what they would be at” — I shall not decide; but ‘tis evident to me, when they affirm, “That they who have seen Paris, have seen every thing,” they must mean to speak of those who have seen it by day-light.","People often find the French language puzzling because the explanations or ways of explaining it can be vague or difficult. Although I avoid pointing fingers at anyone, it's obvious that the saying ""Those who have seen Paris have seen everything"" means that experiencing Paris when it's light outside is a unique and special event."
"But it was the figure you cut as an employee, on an employee’s footing with the girls, in work clothes, and being of that tin-tough, creaking, jazzy bazaar of hardware, glassware, chocolate, chicken-feed, jewelry, drygoods, oilcloth, and song hits—that was the big thing; and even being the Atlases of it, under the floor, hearing how the floor bore up under the ambling weight of hundreds, with the fanning, breathing movie organ next door and the rumble descending from the trolleys on Chicago Avenue—the bloody-rinded Saturday gloom of wind-borne ash, and blackened forms of five-storey buildings rising up to a blind Northern dimness from the Christmas blaze of shops.","As a worker, your being there in work clothes, mixing with the girls among a variety of items from equipment to sweets, was very important in making the store feel energetic and full of life. Even though it couldn't be seen, the busy movement of customers above, along with the sound from the close movie theater and the streetcars' deep sound, added to the mood on a gloomy, breezy Saturday dotted with drifting bits of burnt wood. This situation was very different from the serious, tall buildings that were missing the cheerful brightness of the well-lit stores during the festive period."
"The streets are paved now, and the telephone and electric companies are cutting down more and more of the shade trees–the water oaks, the maples and locusts and elms–to make room for iron poles bearing clusters of bloated and ghostly and bloodless grapes, and we have a city laundry which makes the rounds on Monday morning, gathering the bundles of clothes into bright-colored, specially-made motor cars: the soiled wearing of a whole week now flees apparitionlike behind alert and irritable electric horns, with a long diminishing noise of rubber and asphalt like tearing silk, and even the Negro women who still take in white people’s washing after the old custom, fetch and deliver it in automobiles.","Companies that provide services like electricity and water are cutting down different kinds of trees, such as those with leaves that have deep curves or points, trees that make a sweet, thick liquid, and very high trees with jagged leaves, to put in strong metal frameworks and cables, since the streets have been covered with a hard surface. At the same time, a nearby clothes washing business uses bright-colored trucks to gather clothes for washing every first day of the workweek, leaving with a noise that makes you think of ripping fabric. Furthermore, black women, who in the past often washed clothes for white families, now regularly use trucks to pick up and deliver washed clothes."
The defoliation of millions of acres of trees by massive infestations of gypsy moth caterpillars is a recurring phenomenon in the northeastern United States.,"In the upper right area of the United States, caterpillars of a type of moth often called ""gypsy"" are well-known for eating up lots of leaves over huge areas of woods, spreading over millions of pieces of land, with each piece of land being the same as 4,840 square yards."
"Forest stands of red oaks, with their tannin-rich foliage, may even provide caterpillars with safe havens from disease.","The existence of sharp-tasting materials in the leaves of red trees might act as a defense system for young butterflies, protecting them until they transform into grown-up moths or butterflies and possibly stopping sickness."
"Although a historical lack of access to formal Spanish-language education initially limited the opportunities of some Chicanos to hone their skills as writers of Spanish, their bilingual culture clearly fostered an exuberant and compelling oral tradition.","At first, Americans of Mexican heritage found it hard to improve their writing skills in Spanish because there weren't many chances to learn. But, being able to speak two languages because of their mix of Mexican and American traditions helped them become very good at telling stories out loud."
"Works in English, however, often required the elimination of nuance or colloquialism, the adoption of a formal tone, and the adjustment of themes or ideas to satisfy the different demands of national publications.","Often, English texts are changed to remove informal or subtle phrases, take on a serious style, and tweak the main ideas or subjects to follow the official rules for putting out books or articles in different countries."
"Researchers reasoned that low-frequency sound waves, because they are so well described mathematically and because even small perturbations in emitted sound waves can be detected, could be transmitted through the ocean over many different paths and that the properties of the ocean's interior could be deduced on the basis of how the ocean altered the signals.","Researchers thought that since low sounds can be detected and are responsive to changes, they could be used to investigate the sea. They intended to transmit these sounds through the water and examine the changes to reveal the hidden features of the sea."
"In medical tomography x-rays map the human body's density variations (and hence internal organs); the information from the x-rays, transmitted through the body along many different paths, is recombined to form three-dimensional images of the body's interior.","Medical imaging uses x-rays to create pictures of the inside of the body by spotting differences in how thick or thin the tissues are. The x-rays go through the body from different directions, and this information is then changed into 3D pictures that show what's inside the body's organs and other parts."
"Ironically, now that photography is securely established as a fine art, many photographers find it pretentious or irrelevant to label it as such.","People now commonly recognize photography as a type of art, so much so that many people who take photos don't feel the need to specifically call it art anymore."
"Serious photographers variously claim to be finding, recording, impartially observing, witnessing events, exploring themselves-anything but making works of art.","Serious photographers often talk about their skill as a way to find and record moments or fairly watch what's happening. They usually see their picture-taking as a technique to investigate their own stories, more than just making art."
"This method of pumping heat from one place to another served mankind well when refrigerators' main jobs were preserving food and, as air conditioners, cooling buildings.","Fridges work by moving warmth out to keep food from spoiling, while air cooling units use this process to lower the temperature inside buildings."
"They are based on a robust and effective idea--draw heat from the thing you want to cool by evaporating a liquid next to it, and then dump that heat by pumping the vapour elsewhere and condensing it.","They work by taking in warmth from the item that needs cooling through a liquid that turns into a gas close by. This turned-into-gas liquid is then moved to a different place, where it turns back into a liquid, giving off the warmth it had taken in during the process."
One set of candidates are known as paraelectric materials.,Materials that respond to electric currents are thought about for different uses because they can quickly change when they come into contact with these currents.
"An array of tiny pieces of paraelectric material can sense the heat radiated by, for example, a person, and the pattern of the array's electrical outputs can then be used to construct an image.","A special network made of a one-of-a-kind substance can detect the warmth given off by things, like the heat from a person. It then changes these heat measurements into electric messages, which are used to create a picture you can see."
"One consequence of Moore's Law, which describes the doubling of the number of transistors on a chip every 18 months, is that the amount of heat produced doubles as well.","Gordon Moore's principle indicates that about every 18 months, the number of tiny on-off devices on a computer chip made of a common semiconducting material doubles, which causes the chip to generate more warmth."
"And the idea of shifting from single-core processors to systems that divided processing power between first two, and then four, subunits, in order to spread the thermal load, also seems to have the end of the road in sight.","The concept of using computer chips with several main processing units, like two or four, to control the spread of heat is nearing its highest level of success."
"The trick to a good thermoelectric material is a crystal structure in which electrons can flow freely, but the path of phonons--heat-carrying vibrations that are larger than electrons--is constantly interrupted. In practice, this trick is hard to pull off, and thermoelectric materials are thus less efficient than paraelectric ones (or, at least, than those examined by Dr Mischenko).","To successfully change differences in warmth into electric power, a substance must let electric current move easily while also blocking the transfer of warmth through the shaking of its tiny pieces. Making these substances is difficult, and they usually don't work as well as those substances that respond to electric forces without getting warm, which is what Dr. Mischenko is studying."
"Shy of competition, eager for artificially high prices, they are helping to block the efficient generation, transmission and distribution of energy on the continent.","They avoid competing and prefer keeping prices high, which then obstructs the effective spread and accessibility of energy throughout the area."
"Companies that dominate national markets have, so far, had little interest in improving the interconnections which would mean lower prices for consumers across the continent.","Companies dominating countrywide markets have shown little excitement about upgrading their systems, which might result in reduced costs for shoppers all over the nation."
"The European Commission, which on the same day presented its recommendation for improving EU energy policy, also wants to see the unbundling of ownership, the legal separation of energy suppliers and transporters, something that the integrated energy companies and interested governments, notably in France and Germany, are bound to oppose ferociously.","The European Commission has suggested changes to improve the European Union's energy policy by supporting the separation of energy supply companies from those managing its distribution. However, this suggestion is likely to encounter strong resistance from big energy companies and some national governments, especially in France and Germany, where the concept might not be well received."
The risk is that concerns about security of supply may be used spuriously by those in Europe who oppose the sort of liberalisation encouraged by Ms Kroes.,"In Europe, worries about keeping a steady flow of goods might be claimed by some as an excuse to resist attempts to open up and boost rivalry in the market, a push firmly supported by Ms. Kroes."
"Protection has been tried for long enough and evidently has not worked for the internal market, nor have these companies secured the best deals for consumers from the Russians.","The internal market has faced challenges because its safety steps haven't worked, leading to businesses not being able to get the best deals for buyers when doing business with Russian partners."
"All that is laudable enough, but will also require political horse-trading as governments Europe's leaders are due to meet in March to discuss the various energy proposals try to avoid commitments that may hurt domestic energy companies or make European firms less competitive than rivals in America, Asia and elsewhere.","European officials plan to talk about energy plans in March, but they might be unsure about making any deals that could weaken their local energy businesses or reduce their advantage against American, Asian, and other worldwide companies."
"Achieving either target would mean promoting cleaner cars, a more effective emissions-trading system for Europe, wider use of public transport and a sharp increase in the use of renewable sources of energy, like wind and solar power.","Reaching these eco-friendly objectives needs a complex strategy. This involves encouraging the use of less polluting cars, improving how well Europe's carbon exchange program works, making public transport systems bigger, and greatly growing the dependence on energy sources that can be replenished, like sunlight and wind energy."
"If successful, virus therapy could eventually form a third pillar alongside radiotherapy and chemotherapy in the standard arsenal against cancer, while avoiding some of the debilitating side-effects.","Using viruses as a treatment could become an important way to fight cancer, similar to usual treatments like radiation or drug therapy, but it has the benefit of leading to fewer serious side effects."
Cancer-killing viruses exploit the fact that cancer cells suppress the body's local immune system.,Viruses that kill cancer take advantage of the reduced protective barriers around cancer cells to focus on and eliminate them successfully.
"Prof Seymour's innovative solution is to mask the virus from the body's immune system, effectively allowing the viruses to do what chemotherapy drugs do - spread through the blood and reach tumours wherever they are.","Seymour, an instructor, has created a new way that allows viruses to slip past the body's protective measures, similar to how cancer treatment medications work. This approach lets the virus move through the blood and aim at lumps of abnormal cells without being noticed, preventing destruction by the body's defense system."
"After the stealth virus infects the tumour, it replicates, but the copies do not have the chemical modifications.",The cunning virus slips into a cell and makes copies of itself without changing the cell's chemical makeup.
"Two viruses are likely to be examined in the first clinical trials: adenovirus, which normally causes a cold-like illness, and vaccinia, which causes cowpox and is also used in the vaccine against smallpox.","The first tests on people will probably concentrate on studying the impacts of two particular types of germs: the adenovirus, which is often linked to symptoms similar to a common cold, and the vaccinia virus, recognized for leading to cowpox and being very important in the development of the smallpox vaccine."
"For years European economies had been lagging dismally behind America (to say nothing of Asia), but in 2006 the large continental economies had one of their best years for a decade, briefly outstripping America in terms of growth.","For many years, Europe's economy expanded more slowly than America's and some areas in the East. But in 2006, Europe experienced a notable improvement, with its economy increasing at a speed that exceeded America's for a short time, displaying its strongest performance in a decade."
"Every four or five years, European countries take a large stride towards further integration by signing a new treaty: the Maastricht treaty in 1992, the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, the Treaty of Nice in 2001.","About every four to five years, European countries make significant steps forward in coming together by making new deals. This regular sequence of advancement is shown by important agreements, such as the agreement made in Maastricht in 1992, the one in Amsterdam in 1997, and the one in Nice in 2001, with each deal indicating a move ahead in their shared path toward more unity."
"And in 2005 they were supposed to ratify a European constitution, laying the ground for yet more integration until the calm rhythm was rudely shattered by French and Dutch voters.","In 2005, the goal was to accept a European set of fundamental principles that would bring member countries together, but this plan encountered a surprising obstacle when people who vote in France and the Netherlands said no to it in public votes."
"Government leaders have already agreed to celebrate it ceremoniously, restating their commitment to 'ever closer union' and the basic ideals of European unity.",Officials have made the choice to organize a gathering to honor and renew their dedication to the basic ideas of a more united Europe.
But it does not take a Machiavelli to spot that once governments have signed the declaration (and it seems unlikely anyone would be so uncollegiate as to veto it) they will already be halfway towards committing themselves to a new treaty.,"By agreeing to the declaration, which is expected to get the green light, nations will make an important move towards achieving a new deal, even though they might not be very sharp or smart."
"Neoclassical economics is built on the assumption that humans are rational beings who have a clear idea of their best interests and strive to extract maximum benefit (or 'utility', in economist-speak) from any situation.","Economics of the neoclassical kind assumes that people make logical decisions, with the goal of increasing their gains by choosing the alternatives they think will bring them the most benefit in different circumstances."
"According to the German government which holds the EU's agenda-setting presidency during the first half of 2007, there will be a new draft of a slimmed-down constitution ready by the middle of the year, perhaps to put to voters, perhaps not.","In the first part of 2007, the government of Germany led the European Union's work to make an easier version of its main laws by the middle of the year. This effort aimed to make the laws easier to understand and was supposed to be prepared for possible decision-making, but it was not guaranteed that it would get to that point."
"Then, according to bureaucratic planners in Brussels and Berlin, blithely ignoring the possibility of public rejection, the whole thing will be signed, sealed and a new constitution delivered in 2009-10.","Officials in the capital cities of Belgium and Germany are actively getting ready to introduce a new set of fundamental rules by the year 2009-10, and they are doing this without considering what the general public thinks."
"UK and Australian health agencies have released information about 240 cases of odd occurrences, including sleepwalking, amnesia and hallucinations among people taking the drug zolpidem.","Health officials in the UK and Australia have noted 240 cases of unusual events among individuals using the sleep medication zolpidem, such as walking while asleep, forgetting recent happenings, and seeing things that aren't there."
"While doctors say that zolpidem can offer much-needed relief for people with sleep disorders, they caution that these newly reported cases should prompt a closer look at its possible side effects.","Health professionals suggest using the sleeping pill zolpidem, but they warn about using it because of new discoveries of potential harmful side effects."
"The newly reported cases in the UK and Australia add to a growing list of bizarre sleepwalking episodes linked to the drug in other countries, including reports of people sleep-driving while on the medication.","There is an increasing pattern in the UK, Australia, and all over the world of strange events related to people walking in their sleep, with some individuals even driving while they are not awake, which has been connected to a specific drug."
The drug is a benzodiazepine-like hypnotic that promotes deep sleep by interacting with brain receptors for a chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid.,"The drug works like a sleep aid, encouraging peaceful sleep by working with parts of the brain that react to a relaxant that happens naturally."
"The product information for prescribers advises that psychiatric adverse effects, including hallucinations, sleepwalking and nightmares, are more likely in the elderly, and treatment should be stopped if they occur.","Medical professionals recommend that this drug can lead to mind-related side effects in older people, such as seeing things that aren't there, walking while asleep, and bad dreams. If these signs appear, stopping the use of the drug is recommended."
Patient advocacy groups say they would like government health agencies and drug companies to take a closer look at the possible risks associated with sleep medicines.,Health support groups are strongly encouraging government health departments and medicine companies to pay more attention to the risks connected with sleep-inducing drugs for people receiving medical treatment.
"Millions of people have taken the drug without experiencing any strange side effects, points out Richard Millman at Brown Medical School, director of the Sleep Disorders Center of Lifespan Hospitals in Providence, Rhode Island, US.","Richard Millman, the head of the Sleep Disorders Center at Lifespan's network of hospitals in Providence, Rhode Island, and connected with Brown Medical School, has noticed that the drug in question has been taken by millions without any reports of rare side effects."
"The Guardian has learned that the FSA will launch a series of 10-second television adverts in January telling shoppers how to follow a red, amber and green traffic light labelling system on the front of food packs, which is designed to tackle Britain's obesity epidemic.","In January, the news outlet shared that the UK's food regulation organization intends to start airing short TV ads. These commercials will inform people about an easy-to-understand red, yellow, and green labeling system on food wrappers. This project is one aspect of a wider attempt to address the increasing issue of people being too heavy and extremely overweight in the UK."
"The industry is planning a major marketing campaign for a competing labelling system which avoids colour-coding in favour of information about the percentage of ""guideline daily amounts"" (GDAs) of fat, salt and sugar contained in their products.","The industry is preparing for a big advertising push to launch a new system for labeling and explaining products. This new method will shift away from using colored signs and will plainly show how much fat, salt, and sugar is in a product compared to the daily amounts that are suggested for health."
"Sources at the TV regulators are braced for a legal challenge from the industry and have described the lobbying efforts to block any new ad ban or colour-coded labelling as ""the most ferocious we've ever experienced"".",Industry spokespeople are getting ready to start a legal fight against TV authorities who are planning to put in place a new prohibition on specific commercials and bring in the use of labels with different colors. Authorities point out that the industry's current attempts to stop these new rules are the strongest they have ever witnessed.
"The FSA is understood to have briefed its ad agency, United, before Christmas, and will aim to air ads that are ""non-confrontational, humorous and factual"" as a counterweight to industry's efforts about the same time.","The Food Standards Agency told its advertising company, United, that it planned to show funny and educational ads during the vacation season that would have a friendly and inviting tone. This strategy seeks to even out the promotional work of the industry during this period."
"Ehrlich's model shows that whilst most of these oscillations cancel each other out, some reinforce one another and become long-lived temperature variations.","Ehrlich's idea indicates that although temperature changes usually balance each other out, there are times when they strengthen one another, resulting in lasting shifts in temperature."
"For example, if sea ice begins to form because of a slight cooling, carbon dioxide that would otherwise have found its way into the atmosphere as part of the carbon cycle is locked into the ice.","As the warmth drops a bit and sea ice starts to freeze, the carbon dioxide that would usually escape into the air gets caught within the ice."
"One such cycle describes the way Earth's orbit gradually changes shape from a circle to a slight ellipse and back again roughly every 100,000 years.","Over about 100,000 years, Earth's path around the sun slowly shifts, switching between a more round path and a somewhat oval one."
"However, Edwards believes the small changes in solar heating produced by Milankovitch cycles are then amplified by feedback mechanisms on Earth.","Edwards thinks that the Earth boosts the small changes in sunlight warmth, which come from the planet's slow circular path and tilt changes, by using its natural response systems."
