"Managing down operating costs within such a complex technology environment is extremely difficult. Retiring applications that are tightly coupled within the technical and data architecture results in nearly insurmountable dependency management issues and change risk. Seemingly small projects quickly become big, expensive efforts with extended timeframes. Retiring one application inevitably requires upstream and downstream changes and this added cost erodes the business case and often leads to a decision to leave things as they are.","Cutting down on the money it takes to run things in a tricky tech setting is hard. When you stop using apps that are really mixed into a tricky system, it leads to tough problems with relying on other things and a big chance of trouble. Little tasks can easily turn into big, expensive, and long jobs. Stopping the use of one app often means you have to make a lot of other changes, which can bring surprise expenses that spoil the good things you hoped to get from your original idea. These problems usually make it smarter to leave things as they are, because the possible good points don't make up for the increasing costs and dangers."
"In this editorial for the collection on complexity in mental health research, we introduce and summarize the inaugural contributions to this collection: a series of theoretical, methodological, and empirical papers that aim to chart a path forward for investigating mental health in all its complexity... From physics to ecology, there is a rapidly evolving body of interdisciplinary research dedicated to investigating complex systems.","In this short article, we slowly explain and give a short overview of the new and creative work added to our group of articles about how complicated mental health research can be. The group has many deep thought pieces, high-level ways of doing research, and studies based on observation and experience. Together, these papers work hard to improve how much we know about the complicated parts of mental health. Also, the research takes ideas from different areas like science of matter and energy and the study of living things and their environment, showing off a quickly increasing, mixed-area project to look into complicated systems. This project gives us a lot of information that can help make mental health research better."
"Throughout the twentieth century, much of psychiatry aspired to reductionist simplicity... However, far from uncovering simple etiologies, the past century of psychiatric research has revealed systematic complexity, leading to a growing recognition that mental disorders are dauntingly complex phenomena.","In the 1900s, doctors who study the mind tried to make the complicated brain easier to understand by breaking it down into simple parts to improve how we treat it. Scientists tried to find the main parts of how we think and feel but discovered it was very complicated. They learned that problems with the mind are detailed and can't be quickly sorted into groups. Now, these mind doctors use a method that looks at everything about a person, knowing that body, mind, and life situations all affect someone's mental health. This change shows it's important to look at the whole person when helping with mind-related health issues, instead of just one sign of the problem."
Impulses travel along nerves at a speed called the nerve conduction velocity (NCV). This velocity has been extensively measured in human peripheral nerves because of its utility in clinical medicine. Appreciably decreased NCV can be an important indicator of nerve injury or disease,"Nerve signals travel really quickly through our body's wires, called nerves. This speed is super important for doctors to check. When this speed is much slower than normal, it can mean the nerves are hurt or there's a brain-related problem. Doctors and nurses use these speed checks to figure out what's wrong, help make people better, and see how they're getting on with their nerve problems."
"Social isolation also comes with significant risk of mental health and neuropsychiatric disorders, including chronic anxiety and depression. Alongside this complex aetiology, social isolation has been linked to the increased prevalence of substance use disorders across a range of drug types, where social isolation both predicts drug abuse, and drug abuse occurs as a consequence of social isolation. Unfortunately, when socially isolated individuals wish to moderate or quit drug-intake, quitting is more difficult and less successful, limiting the likelihood of a long lasting recovery","Being alone a lot can make serious mind problems like ongoing worry and sadness worse, and it often goes together with using more drugs. Being alone can make using drugs worse, and it can start a pattern that's hard to stop. Sadly, for people who are very alone, it's tougher to stop using drugs and they might not do as well in getting better, so it's not very likely they'll fully recover. To have a better chance of getting better, it's really important to help with both being alone and using drugs at the same time."
"The mobile nature of digital games ensures that the lines between in-school and out-of-school gameplay is blurred. Thus, it is important to explore the possibilities of these games to create new spaces for learning and engaging with mathematics. From a social learning perspective, research has been concerned with the ways in which the games industry has been influencing ‘interactive’ learning via computers; creating spaces for students to create their own digital games in order to teach concepts to peers; or the ways in which the games are arranged to motivate learners to engage with the games and engage with higher-order problem solving abilities.","Mixing computer games with school and home has become very important to look at how these games can make new, two-way learning areas, especially for math. People who study this are seeing how the growing games business changes learning with high-tech computers, which brings new chances for students to make their own games to make hard ideas clear. Carefully made games can really encourage students to get into the games and grow their ability to solve problems. This mix of gaming and learning makes the learning better and makes students' knowledge of math stronger in a way that fits what they like and what they know from life."
"Fritz et al. implement one of the suggestions by Ioannidis et al., using network analysis to study interrelations among psychological and environmental resilience factors for mental health, such as family support and self-esteem, in adolescents with and without child adversity","Fritz and his team have followed Ioannidis and his group's advice by studying how different things like mental health and surroundings are linked to being able to bounce back from tough times, like having a supportive family and feeling good about oneself. They looked at a diverse group of teenagers, including some who had hard times when they were younger, to make their research useful to more people. By looking at how these things that help people be resilient work together, especially when dealing with stress early in life, Fritz and his team provide important understanding of how being resilient works."
"Mental disorders arise from a host of components across biological, psychological, and social levels of analysis, intertwined in a web of complex interactions... We must go further and understand both the individual components and the complex interactions among them","To really get why people have mental health problems, we need to see how their body, mind, and life situations all work together and impact each other. These parts are all mixed up and change over time, shaping how someone feels inside. To help someone with their mental health in the best way, it's super important to look at everything that could play a part. People who study these things and doctors who work with mental health have to dig deep to find out what's really causing the problems. They need to know a lot about how all these different things connect to make treatments that really fit the person they're helping. These treatments have to be just right for what each person needs."
"Ethical considerations are crucial in AI and ML, as their usage presents significant concerns around privacy, accountability, and command. The potential for algorithms to perpetuate existing biases, responsibility for AI-generated decisions, and the misuse of AI and ML for malicious purposes like cyberattacks and misinformation are key ethical concerns","The right and wrong effects of smart computer programs and learning computers are very important because they are used a lot. These smart systems bring up big worries, like breaking into people's private lives, not being clear who's in charge, and making sure they work right. They might also support unfairness in society with their smart but tricky instructions. Figuring out who should be blamed when smart computer programs go wrong is hard. Also, using smart computer programs and learning computers for bad things, like really good computer attacks and spreading lies on purpose, is a big worry about what's right and wrong. These problems highlight the need for clear rules and careful handling of smart computer programs to make sure they help everyone in a fair way."
"In his numerous writings, Marx critiques capitalism by identifying its flaws... Only once the working class realizes the flaws of the system, Marx believes, will they - must they - rise up against their bourgeois masters and achieve the necessary and inevitable communist revolution.","Marx's thorough work strongly points out the problems with capitalism, revealing how it takes advantage of people. He looks into the serious fight between the rich and the workers, highlighting the big gap between them. Marx strongly believes that when workers understand the big mistakes in capitalism, they will for sure rise up against their rich controllers. He thinks this will happen not just maybe, but for certain, because of the ongoing battle between the classes that is a basic part of capitalism, ending in a takeover by the workers."
"To get a better idea of how lice evolved and spread, a team led by marine biologist Marina S. Ascunce of the University of Florida in Gainesville sequenced the genomes of 463 head lice collected from 38 countries. The researchers found that human head lice belong to two genetically distinct clades, or groups, both of which hitched rides to the Americas on humans.","A group of scientists from all over the world, guided by Marina S. Ascunce, who studies ocean life at the University of Florida in Gainesville, decided to do a thorough investigation to learn about how lice have changed over time and moved around. They looked closely at the DNA of 463 lice gathered from 38 countries. Their work showed that human head lice come in two different DNA types, both of which came to North and South America with humans. This discovery helps us understand how humans moved to new places and how the tiny bugs that live on us traveled with us over time."
"For the last 10 years, the 'Convention of States' movement has sought to remake the Constitution and force a tea party vision of the framers’ intent upon America. This group wants to wholesale rewrite wide swaths of the U.S. Constitution in one fell swoop. In the process, they hope to do away with regulatory agencies like the FDA and the CDC, virtually eliminate the federal government’s ability to borrow money, and empower state legislatures to override federal law.","For the last ten years, a group called the 'Convention of States' has been really focused on a huge goal: to make big changes to the U.S. Constitution. They want to make sure the Constitution is followed in a very strict way, just like the tea party group wants. They plan to change a lot of the Constitution all at once, trying to get rid of big government organizations like the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), really cut down on how much money the government can owe, and give states more power to cancel out federal laws. This could really change how much power states have compared to the federal government, and it could completely change how the U.S. government works."
"Surgeons have given a man suffering from a debilitating lung condition a new lease of life by using breast implants in an unprecedented procedure. After Davey Bauer from Missouri caught the flu a few months ago, he developed a lung infection that was resistant to antibiotics.","A man with a really bad lung problem got help from expert doctors who did a special operation using breast implants. This new kind of operation is usually for changing someone's appearance, but it's now being noticed for its clever use in medicine. Davey Bauer from Missouri was fighting a hard-to-beat lung infection after getting a bad case of the flu, and even powerful germ-killing drugs didn't work. Wanting to fix this, his doctors decided to try the rare idea of using breast implants, and in the end, it worked and he got better."
"A long-beaked echidna, named after David Attenborough and thought to be extinct, has been rediscovered in the mountains of Indonesia. The long-lost species of mammal is described as having the spines of a hedgehog, the snout of an anteater and the feet of a mole.","A special kind of animal called an echidna, which has a really long nose like a bird's beak and is named after a famous nature guy, Sir David Attenborough, was thought to be gone forever but has been found again in hard-to-reach mountains in a country called Indonesia. People are now really interested again in saving these one-of-a-kind animals that live in places far away from others. This weird-looking creature, which people hadn't seen in a while, has sharp points on its back like a hedgehog, a long nose for eating ants like an anteater, and feet that are good for digging like a mole's. This discovery shows how cool and different animals can be because of how they've changed over time, and it reminds us why it's important to keep them safe so we can learn more and help the places where they live stay healthy."
"The emergence of miniature and micro-products and components is increasingly demanding the production of parts with dimensions in the range of a few tens of nanometers to a few millimeters. Micro-/nano-cutting is one of the key technologies to enable the realization of micro-products, while a great many micro-manufacturing processes have been developed.","People want more and more really small, detailed things, so making these tiny parts very accurately is super important. Tiny cutting methods that work on the really small scale are leading the way. They can make parts as small as just a little bit bigger than atoms, all the way up to the size of a small ant. Companies are coming up with lots of new ways to make these small parts really well, showing they really care about coming up with new ideas. These ways of making things are key for making stuff now and for making even smaller stuff later on."
"Within this structuralist, defense-in-depth approach, safety margins against these scenarios are enforced through conservative regulations of system design and operation, under the creed that the identified worst-case, credible accidents would envelope all credible accidents for what regards the challenges and stresses posed on the system and its protections. The underlying principle has been that if a system is designed to withstand all the worst-case credible accidents, then it is ‘by definition’ protected against any credible accident","This safety method uses a layered protection plan with extra room for error to guard against well-studied possible problems. Strict rules control how the system is built and works to make sure it's strong enough to handle the most severe, believable mishaps, which we think include all believable mishaps. The idea is that if a system can deal with the toughest situations, it will naturally be able to survive any believable mishap. This basic rule tries to keep the system whole and working right, even when things get really tough, giving a strong promise of safety for the system and the people using it."
"A constant failure rate (CFR) is indicative of externally induced failures, as in the constant hazard rate situation for non-repairable items. A CFR is also typical of complex systems subject to repair and overhaul, where different parts exhibit different patterns of failure with time and parts have different ages since repair or replacement. Repairable systems can show a decreasing failure rate (DFR) when reliability is improved by progressive repair, as defective parts which fail relatively early are replaced by good parts. ‘Burn in’ is applied to electronic systems, as well as to parts, for this purpose.","A steady chance of breaking (CFR) means things often break because of outside causes, especially in things that aren't fixed, and in tricky systems that are checked and fixed often. Each part in these systems breaks in its own way and lasts a certain amount of time after being fixed. At the same time, systems that can be fixed might break less often (DFR) because they get better every time they are fixed, by putting in new, working parts instead of broken ones. The 'burn-in' step helps by getting rid of the parts that aren't strong early on, which makes the system break less often (DFR) as it gets more trustworthy as time goes on."
"It should be noted that, although the system engineering process is applicable in all phases of the life cycle, this is not to imply that any single organizational entity within a given project is responsible for the completion of all of the tasks necessary to accomplish these objectives. The process must be an “inherent” element within any given program structure, and the successful fulfillment of such objectives is dependent on many different organizational groups, working in a cooperative and integrated manner.","The process of designing and building systems is very important and needs to be included in every step of a project's life. But it's not just one part of the group that does everything. This process should be a main part of the project's setup, and it works best when different groups within the group work together well and as a team. Teams working together is not just useful, but necessary, for the process of designing and building systems to be successful and meet its targets."
"Thompson and Zhi acknowledge that the AI models are only as good as the data on which they’re trained. There is a lack of racial and geographical diversity in individuals who have had their brains scanned and genomes sequenced, especially in databases such as the UK Biobank, so the findings from this AI-guided research might not be applicable to everyone. Furthermore, Goate says it will be crucial to show that the AI models’ performance can be replicated in other databases, and that they show consistent results.","Thompson and Zhi say that how well AI works depends a lot on how good the information is that we use to teach it. They've noticed a big problem: there's not enough variety in the brain pictures and gene information, especially in big collections like the UK Biobank. This could mean that AI might not be useful for everyone. Goate makes this problem seem even bigger, emphasizing how crucial it is to show that AI can do a good job for different kinds of people and give trustworthy results. This shows that we really need to collect more information that includes everyone so that AI can help all of us."
"Now recall that the underlying LLM’s task, given the dialogue prompt followed by a piece of user-supplied text, is to generate a continuation that conforms to the distribution of the training data, which are the vast corpus of human-generated text on the Internet. What will such a continuation look like? If the model has generalized well from the training data, the most plausible continuation will be a response to the user that conforms to the expectations we would have of someone who fits the description in the preamble. In other words, the dialogue agent will do its best to role-play the character of a dialogue agent as portrayed in the dialogue prompt.","The job of the basic computer program is to keep the chat going from a tricky starting point and what the person using it says, using what it learned from a lot of stuff on the internet. It should give a full and believable answer that looks like what a smart person would say, just like the starting point says. In short, the program tries to pretend to be the person from the starting point to make sure the talk makes sense and is on topic."
"Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas. Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.","In 2006, Hamas, a Palestinian group, won the elections. By 2007, they controlled the Gaza Strip, which made Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Fatah group, lose power there. This caused a lot of stress and fighting with Israel. To try to control Hamas and prevent them from sending rockets into Israel, both Israel and Egypt stopped goods and people from moving in and out of Gaza. People living in Gaza say that the blockade and the attacks from the air by Israel are unfairly hurting everyone there. They talk about how hard life is because of these actions while the fighting continues."
"If being a spokesman for a generation is a fleeting occupation, being a symbol of an era is downright dangerous for anyone who has the bad luck to outlive it. In the next few years the expatriate Fitzgerald continued to publish stories about flappers and giddy undergraduates in the Saturday Evening Post even as he struggled with alcohol and Zelda's increasingly unstable mental state. Travelling with Zelda in North Africa in 1930, he wrote about hearing ""a dull distant crash which echoed to the farthest wastes of the desert"".","Speaking for a whole group of young people is a short-lived and risky job, especially for those who survive past the time when they are popular. As time passed, F. Scott Fitzgerald, who was now living in another country, kept writing stories for the ""Saturday Evening Post"" that showed the energy of carefree young women and happy university students, even though he was fighting his own addiction to alcohol and his wife Zelda's mind was getting worse. On a journey to North Africa with Zelda in 1930, Fitzgerald felt something very deep. He heard a loud noise far away in the desert, a sound that rang out with no answer and made him feel like his own once-fancy life was falling apart."
"This despite the fact that I can say (like everyone else on Harvard’s campus in the fall of 2003) that “I was there” at Facebook’s inception, and remember Facemash and the fuss it caused; also that tiny, exquisite movie star trailed by fan-boys through the snow wherever she went, and the awful snow itself, turning your toes gray, destroying your spirit, bringing a bloodless end to a squirrel on my block: frozen, inanimate, perfect—like the Blaschka glass flowers. Doubtless years from now I will misremember my closeness to Zuckerberg, in the same spirit that everyone in ’60s Liverpool met John Lennon.","I remember being at a big university called Harvard during the autumn of 2003 when a website called Facebook began, and there was a lot of excitement about another website called Facemash and a well-known young woman who acted in movies and was always surrounded by her enthusiastic supporters. The cold, biting snow would make our feet very cold and lessen our cheerfulness, and I remember seeing a small animal with a bushy tail that had become so cold it stopped moving, looking as perfectly kept as the delicate glass models of plants. As time goes by, my memories of being near the guy who started Facebook, Zuckerberg, might get a little stretched, kind of like how people from a city called Liverpool in the 1960s say they met the famous musician John Lennon, showing how as time passes, we tend to make our past seem more exciting and special than it might have been."
"Rakesh Khurana has amply shown how this delusion of the charismatic savior creates a dysfunctional market for CEOs, allowing the small number of existing public-company CEOs to demand and receive extravagant compensation. The myth of the generalist CEO is bolstered by the many fawning media portrayals where CEOs say that their key jobs are understanding, hiring, and motivating people—leading board members to believe that you can run a technology company without knowing anything about technology.","Rakesh Khurana has pointed out that the idea of a perfect, very charming boss leads to a situation where a few bosses get paid way too much. This false story is kept alive by TV and newspapers that make it seem like CEOs can do anything and know everything. They say their biggest talents are getting people excited and knowing a lot about different things. This makes the people in charge think that you don't need to really get how technology works to run a tech company. This keeps the habit of thinking being likable is more important than really knowing the technical stuff."
"At first, it’s a solipsistic fantasy—the secret sharer you can tell your troubles to, or that only you understand. Later, it’s rooted in a more philosophical curiosity, the longing to experience the ineffable interiority of some very different being. My eight-year-old daughter says that she wishes the horses she rides could talk, just so she could ask them what it feels like to be a horse. Such a desire presumes—as Thomas Nagel put it in his 1974 essay “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?”—that animals have some kind of subjectivity, and that it might somehow be plumbed. ","At first, the idea is just for fun—a hidden buddy to tell your sad feelings to, or a special friend that only you get. But as more time passes, this daydream becomes a serious journey to find out the hidden feelings of a totally different living thing. Look at my little girl, who enjoys horseback riding and dreams they could speak. She's curious about their emotions, showing she thinks that animals, just like people, have their own awareness. This reminds us of Thomas Nagel's well-known question about a bat's experience, hinting that maybe we can share thoughts with different kinds of animals."
"I dare say, to deciphering the enigma behind the obsessive, pitch-black fiction. Joseph Heller, the opposite of demonstrative, was given to oblique ways of showing affection….  That was the year Heller published his second novel, “Something Happened,” which Daugherty commends as follows: “Joe stepped beyond Wilson’s sentimentality and Yates’s bitterness to eviscerate modern America’s success ethic.” ","To really understand the heart of dark and detailed stories that you can't stop thinking about, you need to look deep into the thoughts of the people who make them, like Joseph Heller. Heller, who didn't often share his feelings with everyone, shared his thoughts in ways that were not always direct, and this showed in his complex way of writing. In 1974, Heller's book ""Something Happened"" showed a big change in his writing, and it got a lot of praise from people who judge books, like Daugherty, for its sharp analysis of how Americans are chasing success but feeling empty. Heller's books were known for their deep look into the American dream, showing the emptiness that can hide under the chase for money and things. His brave way of telling stories and talking about society made him known as a strong voice in American books."
"At a certain point, though—to say exactly when would ruin a fairly stunning surprise—the cat-and-mouse psychology is jettisoned in favor of something more procedural. The two halves of “Love Crime” divide according to the words of the title: the first explores the knotty, feverish, ambiguous bond between Christine and Isabelle, while the second is all about guilt, innocence, evidence and motive. It is interesting and ingenious, even if some of the kinky, queasy fascination that had been so intoxicating in the earlier scenes ebbs away.","In ""Love Crime,"" the movie takes an unexpected turn from a mind game between two people, like a cat chasing a mouse, to a story about solving a mystery, reflecting the two themes in its name. The beginning part looks closely at the strong and puzzling connection between Christine and Isabelle, but then it switches to figuring out who is guilty, who is innocent, and why things happened. Even though the movie stays interesting and is done well, the spooky and disturbing appeal of the first part becomes a little less as the plot goes on."
"If Dickens’s prose fiction has “defects”—excesses of melodrama, sentimentality, contrived plots, and manufactured happy endings—these are the defects of his era, which for all his greatness Dickens had not the rebellious spirit to resist; he was at heart a crowd-pleaser, a theatrical entertainer, with no interest in subverting the conventions of the novel as his great successors D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf would have; nor did he contemplate the subtle and ironic counterminings of human relations in the way of George Eliot and Thomas Hardy, who brought to the English novel an element of nuanced psychological realism not previously explored.","Charles Dickens, a well-known writer, has been critiqued for making his stories overly dramatic, too emotional, using unrealistic storylines, and always ending them on a happy note. These parts of his work, though, were just what people liked during the time he lived, which Dickens accepted without trying to change it, since he aimed to entertain rather than make big changes in writing. Different from Dickens, later writers like D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf tried to completely change how novels were written. Also, other writers from the same time, like George Eliot and Thomas Hardy, did a better job than Dickens at showing the complex inner thoughts and feelings of characters, giving a deeper and more thoughtful look at how people interact than Dickens's more straightforward and less detailed style."
"F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby by no means serves as a blanket condemnation of the American dream; instead, the author uses the novel and its upwardly mobile protagonist to celebrate the ability of those not born of wealth to rise to the pinnacle of American society while also examining the costs that can accompany such success. When this duality is understood, the book’s descriptions of the glittering banality of the upper-class lifestyle can be seen as a critique of the hollowness of strictly material success, rather than simply demonstrating that Fitzgerald possessed, as Trilling described it, “a taste for aristocracy.”","F. Scott Fitzgerald's book ""The Great Gatsby"" is often not fully understood as just a negative view of the American dream, but looking closer shows a more complicated story. Fitzgerald doesn't just point out the bad parts but also shows the good sides of the American dream, especially through the main character's journey from simple beginnings to becoming very wealthy. He also explores the big cost of this success. The book's detailed writing does more than just set up the background; it highlights the hollowness of a life that only cares about money. Instead of only liking the upper class, as Lionel Trilling thinks, Fitzgerald gives a careful look at the appeal and risks of the American dream, making the book a rich and lasting thought on American life."
"For instance, when provided with a pollen-generating food source, bees will develop the capacity to feed on pollen, known as pollinivory; this finding does help to explain the explosion in bee species some 120 million years ago. The study also validates the theory that bees evolved from a species of carnivorous wasps. While pollinivory was confirmed as an important step in the process of bee speciation, the study overturned the previous hypothesis that this factor by itself was the cause of the diversification of bee species.","Bees, when they find a lot of pollen, quickly change to eat only that, which is called pollinivory. This change helps us understand how suddenly there were many more types of bees about 120 million years ago. The research backs up the thought that bees came from meat-eating wasps and that eating pollen was important in making more kinds of bees. But it also questions the too simple idea that just eating pollen made bees become so varied, hinting that many things played a part in how well bees did over time."
"Though volcanic eruptions emit carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, the atmospheric concentration of this gas is about 16000 times the amount released by volcanic eruptions; therefore, no matter how large a volcanic eruption is, it cannot produce a significant change in the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Further, the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted per year by volcanic eruptions – between 130 and 230 million tons – is roughly equivalent to that emitted in only three to five days of human activity.","Volcanoes send out carbon dioxide, but it's a very tiny amount when you look at what people make. There's 16,000 times more carbon dioxide in the air than what a big volcano can send out. So, it's not common for a volcano to really make a big difference in the amount of carbon dioxide in the air. Every year, volcanoes let out 130 to 230 million tons of carbon dioxide, but people do the same in just a few days. When you compare the two, it's clear that what we do has a much bigger effect on putting greenhouse gases into the air than what happens naturally with volcanoes."
"Most of Werner's metaphorical moments were painterly - the juxtaposing of the wild bird and the tame tree, the shimmer of the periwinkle, the splurt of titanium white that fell from it onto the pavement. He loved New York for its simple surprises, although in truth, Oregon and Iowa and Arizona and everywhere else had simple surprises as well. Cantaloupe-colored sunrises, banded cows, Dairy Queens, all kinds of things that didn't include black plastic mountains of trash and the smell of dog urine.","Werner created pictures that were really clear and reminded you of an artist's painting. He showed bright and eye-catching things like a colorful bird next to a quiet tree, a light blue flower with a soft shine, and a surprising white splash on a dark sidewalk. He really liked New York because it had simple things that made you happy when you least expected it. But places like Oregon, Iowa, and Arizona had their own special things too. They had things like the gentle colors of a quiet morning or the designs on cows in green fields, and the old-time charm of ice cream shops. These things felt like a breath of fresh air compared to the plainness of the city, with its tall stacks of garbage bags and the strong smell of pee on the hot city ground."
"The Times, in a welcome but highly uncharacteristic embrace of anarchy, celebrated this development as an ingenious guerrilla tactic in youth's eternal war against adult authority-""a bit of techno-jujitsu,"" as the paper put it. But it's not entirely clear which side is the winner here. When you hear the tone, it apparently sets your teeth on edge, which means that, if the entire class suddenly grimaces, it's a good bet that one of the students just got a text message.","A new, smart way of young people fighting back against grown-ups in charge has been called ""high-tech techno-jujitsu"" by the Times, and they think it's really good. We don't know yet what will happen from this silent fight. When there's a sharp, high sound, it usually means a student has quietly gotten a text, which you can tell because everyone in the room suddenly makes a face. This sound, which usually only younger ears can hear, brings an unexpected change to the constant struggle between old and young over who gets to make their own choices."
"And finally, for most Americans, the War of Imagination - built of nationalistic excitement and ideological hubris and administration pronouncements about ""spreading democracy"" and ""greetings with sweets and flowers,"" and then about ""dead-enders"" and ""turning points,"" and finally about ""staying the course"" and refusing to ""cut and run"" -began, under the pressure of nearly three thousand American dead and perhaps a hundred thousand or more dead Iraqis, to give way to grim reality.","The War of Imagination was at first very popular among Americans, who felt a lot of national pride and were sure that their government's plans to bring democracy and be welcomed as heroes would work. People really believed this. As time passed, the government's way of speaking changed, trying to make the problems seem less serious by talking about ""people who won't give up"" and ""important moments,"" but they kept saying they should keep going and not stop too soon. But as the war continued, the great weight of it, with thousands of American and Iraqi people dying, slowly wore away the early high hopes. This caused people to start thinking more realistically and made Americans look again at what the war was really costing and what they were getting from it."
"In the last hundred years intellectual advances of science and politics have in like fashion been crystallized into material of instruction and now resist further change. I would not say that the spirit of teaching is hostile to that of liberal inquiry, but a philosophy which exists largely as something to be taught rather than wholly as something to be reflected upon is conducive to discussion of views held by others rather than to immediate response. Philosophy when taught inevitably magnifies the history of past thought, and leads professional philosophers to approach their subject-matter through its formulation in received systems. ","In the last 100 years, big changes in science and government ideas have become a fixed part of school lessons, and they don't change easily. Even though teaching doesn't always fight against new ideas, the way philosophy is usually taught in schools encourages a lot of talking about what other people have thought instead of coming up with new thoughts. When philosophy is taught in an organized way, it often focuses a lot on the long history of old thoughts. This focus makes expert thinkers mostly stick to old, accepted ways of thinking, which might stop new ideas and deep talks about today's issues."
"It was the preliminary dwarfing and deliquescence of the mature old beside the embryonic mass of the new. It was impossible then—it is, I believe, only beginning to be possible now—to estimate the proportions, possibilities, and inter-relations of the new social orders out of which a social organization has still to be built in the coming years. No formula of definite reconstruction had been evolved, or has even been evolved yet, after a hundred years.","The old, once strong and honored, started to get weak and fall apart too soon, while the new, filled with fresh ideas, grew quickly. No one could predict how much and how far the new social groups would go. A well-planned community hadn't been made yet from these early stages. Now, a hundred years later, we're just starting to learn how to set up these new social systems. There's no clear way to rebuild, even with the knowledge we've gotten over time. We're at an important moment where we need to mix past lessons with today's fresh ideas to make a future that's both steady and able to change. This calls for our best work and original thinking to make a community that lasts and serves its people well."
"We are never so apt to lose our sense of proportion as when we consider those beloved writers whom we hold to be humourists because they have made us laugh. It may be conceded that, as a people, we have an abiding and somewhat disquieting sense of fun. We are nimble of speech, we are more prone to levity than to seriousness, we are able to recognize a vital truth when it is presented to us under the familiar aspect of a jest, and we habitually allow ourselves certain forms of exaggeration, accepting, perhaps unconsciously, Hazlitt's verdict: ""Lying is a species of wit, and shows spirit and invention.""","We really enjoy and laugh loudly at funny stories from authors we think are great at making jokes. We get so into it that we sometimes think they're the best at being funny. This shows that we really love to have a good time. We're good at thinking of funny things fast and we usually prefer being funny over being serious. We also like it when important ideas are told to us in a funny way. We're okay with people making things sound bigger or more dramatic than they are because it can be a clever way to make us laugh. This idea is similar to what Hazlitt said, which is basically that making stuff up can be a smart way to be funny. This shows how closely related making jokes and telling the truth can be for us."
"The stage in these volumes presents itself indeed not merely as a mirror of life, but as an illustration of the utmost intensity of life, in the fortunes and characters of the players. Ups and downs, generosity, dark fates, the most delicate goodness, have nowhere been more prominent than in the private existence of those devoted to the public mimicry of men and women. Contact with the stage, almost throughout its history, presents itself as a kind of touchstone, to bring out the bizarrerie, the theatrical tricks and contrasts, of the actual world.","In these well-made books, the background setting is more than just scenery; it's an active part that grabs the real feeling of life's exciting events with the good and bad, nice acts, puzzles, and good qualities of its people. People who commit their time to the art of plays feel life's strong emotions in a special way. The stage has always been like a reflection, showing the odd habits, fake appearances, and differences of the real world, and it acts as a strong way of looking that lets us peek into the center of our communities."
"It is this salutary organ of the will of all which establishes, in civil right, the natural equality between men. It is this celestial voice which dictates to each citizen the precepts of public reason, and teaches him to act according to the rules of his own judgment, and not to behave inconsistently with himself. It is with this voice alone that political rulers should speak when they command; for no sooner does one man, setting aside the law, claim to subject another to his private will, than he departs from the state of civil society, and confronts him face to face in the pure state of nature, in which obedience is prescribed solely by necessity.","This peaceful part of our group's shared decision-making is very important for making sure everyone is treated the same by the law and serves as a sacred guide helping people to use common sense and make their own decisions. It is the way political bosses should lead and have power because when someone forces their wishes on someone else, not caring about the law, they go back to a wild, basic way of living where only survival matters. This shows how much we need to listen to everyone's opinion to maintain a well-behaved community."
"Evolutionary psychology takes as its starting point the uncontroversial assertion that the anatomical and physiological features of the human brain have arisen as a result of adaptations to the demands of the environment over the millennia. However, from this reasonable point of departure, these psychologists make unreasonable extrapolations. They claim that the behavior of contemporary man (in almost all its aspects) is a reflection of features of the brain that acquired their present characteristics during those earliest days of our species when early man struggled to survive and multiply.","The study of how our minds changed over time to help us deal with old challenges says that our brains got better in ways that affected both our bodies and how we act. This area of research believes that actions that helped people stay alive and have children became a deep part of how we think and feel. For instance, the need for our early family members to quickly spot danger might be the reason we have strong feelings today. But, people who question this study say we shouldn't use these old situations to explain today's life too much, and they point out that culture, our own stories, and the choices we make also play a big part in how we act. It's key to look closely at what this study of the mind says, while also seeing the many things that can change how people act."
"In regard to propaganda the early advocates of universal literacy and a free press envisaged only two possibilities: the propaganda might be true, or it might be false. They did not foresee what in fact has happened, above all in our Western capitalist democracies - the development of a vast mass communications industry, concerned in the main neither with the true nor the false, but with the unreal, the more or less totally irrelevant. In a word, they failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions.","People who first wanted everyone to read and have access to news thought that information given to the public would be either correct or incorrect. They didn't expect a huge industry focused on sharing information to develop, which sometimes doesn't care about what's true or not and instead focuses on things that don't matter and take our attention away. This industry provides what people really want to see and enjoy, which is something the original supporters didn't think about."
"There must therefore be an intrinsic connection between the conditions and the structural adaptations of the organism, and, since the conditions of life cannot be determined by the animal itself, the adaptations must be called forth by the conditions. The selection theory teaches us how this is conceivable, since it enables us to understand that there is a continual production of what is non-purposive as well as of what is purposive, but the purposive alone survives, while the non-purposive perishes in the very act of arising. This is the old wisdom taught long ago by Empedocles.","Living things have body features that help them fit into their surroundings. These features are closely connected to where they live. Because living things can't change where they live, they have to change over time to keep living. The idea of natural selection tells us how these changes happen. It says that even though living things can have different traits that may or may not help them, only the helpful traits stay around. This concept goes back to a thinker named Empedocles and is very important for us to know how living things change over time."
"As their name suggests, rare collectibles are scarce, hard to find items. They can be antiques that are desirable because of their age, type of craftsmanship or some other unique feature that represents the past. Some rare collectibles are so old that they are considered to be antiquities - artifacts of an ancient civilization such as ancient Greek or ancient Chinese society. Alternatively, rare collectibles can be of very recent origin, sometimes being only a few years old. The common denominator of all rare collectibles, no matter what their type or age, is rarity. Frequently, because of their scarcity and their appeal, rare collectibles are also valuable. ","Very special and not often found items that people really want to have are always in demand because there aren't many of them. These items can be very old, from long ago times, or newer, but they all have something special about them that makes them worth a lot. These items, which could be old things made with great skill or objects from past groups of people like the Greeks or old Chinese, are loved because they show us what life was like a long time ago. Even items that aren't very old but are still not common have this same special quality that makes people want them. Because there aren't many of these items around, and people really want them, they often cost a lot of money. People who love collecting things really want to get these items because they are interesting or beautiful, and they will compete with others to get them."
"Therefore, though the situation seems dark in the context of the confrontation between the superpowers, the silver lining is provided by amazing phenomenon that the very nations which have spent incalculable resources and energy for the production of deadly weapons are desperately trying to find out how they might never be used. They threaten each other, intimidate each other and go to the brink, but before the total hour arrives they withdraw from the brink.","In the middle of growing stress between strong countries, there's a surprising bit of hope. These countries, which have spent a lot of money on making big, destructive weapons, are now really trying to make sure these weapons stay un-used. They sometimes act in scary ways and almost get into fights, but they always stop before things get really bad. This shows that they understand how bad war would be and are trying to prevent it by using careful talks and strategies to scare each other off, even though they sometimes act tough."
"Irrespective of how small these differences might be, they are crucial, and the disequilibrium is maintained by air near the surface mixing with air higher up, which is typically appreciably cooler and lower in water vapor content. The turbulence, which takes its energy from the wind mixes the air. As the speed of wind increases, so does the turbulence, and consequently the rate of heat and moisture transfer. We can arrive at a detailed understanding of this phenomenon after further study. The transfer of momentum from wind to water, which occurs when waves are formed is an interacting-and complicated phenomenon.","These little changes in the air around us, even if they seem small, are very important for causing unevenness. The air close to the ground, which is warmer and has more water in it, blends with the air above that is cooler and has less water, making the air chaotic. This chaos gets its power from powerful winds, and the stronger the wind, the more chaotic it gets, leading to more heat and water being swapped around. Figuring out this complicated process needs a lot of careful study. Also, the way that strong winds push the water, making waves, is a complex thing that we should look into more."
"The interconnectedness of brain and body has tantalizing implications for our ability to both understand and treat illness. If some brain conditions start outside the brain, then perhaps therapies for them could also reach in from outside. Treatments that take effect through the digestive system, heart or other organs, for instance, would be much easier and less invasive to administer than those that must cross the blood–brain barrier, the brain’s first line of defence against pathogens and other insults from the body.","Learning how the mind and body work together can lead to new, thrilling ways to heal sicknesses. If a brain problem begins in a different body part, we might fix it without having to work directly on the brain. This new way might be easier and not as harsh as the old ways that struggle to get through the brain's shield, which stops a lot of cures. By understanding how the body can change the mind, we could find simpler and better ways to help people who are sick."
"The French are certainly misunderstood: — but whether the fault is theirs, in not sufficiently explaining themselves, or speaking with that exact limitation and precision which one would expect on a point of such importance, and which, moreover, is so likely to be contested by us — or whether the fault may not be altogether on our side, in not understanding their language always so critically as to know “what they would be at” — I shall not decide; but ‘tis evident to me, when they affirm, “That they who have seen Paris, have seen every thing,” they must mean to speak of those who have seen it by day-light.","The French sometimes seem hard to understand, and we don't know if it's because they don't make things clear or if we just don't get what they're saying. It's tough to figure out who's to blame for this misunderstanding. But it's obvious that when the French talk about Paris, they really believe that if you've seen their city, you've seen it all. They're not just happy about Paris; they're also saying that Paris has a huge variety of things to do and see, and you should see them when it's light outside to really enjoy them."
"But it was the figure you cut as an employee, on an employee’s footing with the girls, in work clothes, and being of that tin-tough, creaking, jazzy bazaar of hardware, glassware, chocolate, chicken-feed, jewelry, drygoods, oilcloth, and song hits—that was the big thing; and even being the Atlases of it, under the floor, hearing how the floor bore up under the ambling weight of hundreds, with the fanning, breathing movie organ next door and the rumble descending from the trolleys on Chicago Avenue—the bloody-rinded Saturday gloom of wind-borne ash, and blackened forms of five-storey buildings rising up to a blind Northern dimness from the Christmas blaze of shops.","You really stood out as you worked hard among the busy girls in the market, wearing clothes that were sensible and fitting in with the colorful and busy place full of different things. Under the ground, you were like never-tiring strong people, holding up the active place where the floor took on the weight of all the people. The close-by theater's big music instrument and the deep sounds from the streetcars on Chicago Avenue added to the market's beat. On the other hand, the sad, dusty wind and the tall, dark buildings were in sharp difference to the well-lit stores, showing off the full-of-energy but even city life where hard work and happy celebration came together."
"The streets are paved now, and the telephone and electric companies are cutting down more and more of the shade trees–the water oaks, the maples and locusts and elms–to make room for iron poles bearing clusters of bloated and ghostly and bloodless grapes, and we have a city laundry which makes the rounds on Monday morning, gathering the bundles of clothes into bright-colored, specially-made motor cars: the soiled wearing of a whole week now flees apparitionlike behind alert and irritable electric horns, with a long diminishing noise of rubber and asphalt like tearing silk, and even the Negro women who still take in white people’s washing after the old custom, fetch and deliver it in automobiles.","The once calm streets now have smooth sidewalks carefully put in place, and the once plentiful shady trees, like water oaks, maples, locusts, and elms, are being chopped down by phone and power companies. Instead, tall metal poles with bunches of wires that look like ugly bunches of berries are being put up, changing the look of the area. In the middle of these changes, the city's laundry service keeps working, picking up soiled clothes in bright-colored vehicles every Monday, breaking the silence with their noisy horns and the sound of tires on the road. Even the old washing habits of the local Black women have changed; they now use modern cars to collect and drop off laundry, showing the unavoidable spread of new technology."
The defoliation of millions of acres of trees by massive infestations of gypsy moth caterpillars is a recurring phenomenon in the northeastern United States.,"In the top right part of the United States, the same problem keeps happening again and again: forests are being badly damaged by gypsy moth baby butterflies. This big problem has serious results. These outbreaks take away all the leaves from trees, altering the view and messing up the balance of living things in the area. Without leaves, trees can't make as much of the air we breathe or soak up the harmful air stuff that warms our planet, which makes the air worse and increases the amount of this harmful air stuff in the sky. The ground, now exposed to strong sunbeams, might wear away more quickly. To keep these forests and our surroundings safe, it's really important to come up with and use good plans to deal with these outbreaks."
"Forest stands of red oaks, with their tannin-rich foliage, may even provide caterpillars with safe havens from disease.","Thick woods with very tall red oak trees give caterpillars a safe place away from sickness because the leaves have a lot of tannins, which are like a shield. These woods are key to keeping nature in harmony, as they make a secure home for caterpillars, showing that nature there is doing well. When caterpillars are thriving, it shows that there's not much sickness in the forest, which is great for all the different living things there. Keeping these areas safe is super important for the life of many animals and plants and for the well-being of our planet."
"Although a historical lack of access to formal Spanish-language education initially limited the opportunities of some Chicanos to hone their skills as writers of Spanish, their bilingual culture clearly fostered an exuberant and compelling oral tradition.","Many Mexican-Americans couldn't learn to write in Spanish well because there weren't many Spanish classes. However, they were good at telling stories out loud. These stories were an important part of who they were and included old tales that were well-known in their community. Later, these storytellers began to write down their stories, making them even better. This started a new wave of Mexican-American writing. Even though it was hard for them to learn to write at first, by accident, they made a special and powerful way of sharing their culture."
"Works in English, however, often required the elimination of nuance or colloquialism, the adoption of a formal tone, and the adjustment of themes or ideas to satisfy the different demands of national publications.","Turning English stories into other languages often meant taking out small, special details and everyday language to keep a proper, serious style that fits with books or articles for people from different countries. This job wasn't just about words but also about knowing what different readers like and what might upset them. People who change the language of a text and those who fix it up had to try hard to keep the main spirit of the story while also making it easy to connect with and appealing to folks from all sorts of places."
"Researchers reasoned that low-frequency sound waves, because they are so well described mathematically and because even small perturbations in emitted sound waves can be detected, could be transmitted through the ocean over many different paths and that the properties of the ocean's interior could be deduced on the basis of how the ocean altered the signals.","Scientists have discovered that deep, slow-moving sound waves, which are very exact and based on math, are perfect for studying the deep parts of the sea. These waves can go in different directions through the sea, and even tiny differences in them can be noticed. While the waves travel through the water, different things like the warmth and saltiness of the sea can change the sound waves in small ways. By looking closely at these changes, experts can find out about what's inside the sea, like how warm it is, how salty it is, and what the bottom looks like, showing hidden things under the top layer."
"In medical tomography x-rays map the human body's density variations (and hence internal organs); the information from the x-rays, transmitted through the body along many different paths, is recombined to form three-dimensional images of the body's interior.",Medical scanning takes clear pictures of what's inside the body without cutting it open. It uses special machines and computers to make really detailed pictures of what's inside a person. Doctors use these pictures to see if something is wrong inside the body before it gets really bad. This method is super important today for finding out what's wrong with someone and helping them get better. It's like having superhero vision that can see through people and spot health problems early on.
"Ironically, now that photography is securely established as a fine art, many photographers find it pretentious or irrelevant to label it as such.","Photography has become well-known as an important type of art. Today, many people who take photos think it's not needed or too show-offy to say it's a fancy art. This has led to a mix in the art community where people like photography because anyone can enjoy it, but some still want it to be considered very special. To handle this, a lot of photographers today focus on the natural value of their pictures instead of stressing about how people sort it into groups. This helps them try new things in photography without being stopped by outdated opinions or names."
"Serious photographers variously claim to be finding, recording, impartially observing, witnessing events, exploring themselves-anything but making works of art.","Photographers who really love what they do say that taking pictures is more than just snapping photos; it's about really getting to know the world. They take pictures of what's around them very thoughtfully, trying to show things as they really are, and focusing on small things that others might not notice. By doing this, they help us remember important events. These photographers also think about their own feelings and reasons for taking pictures, which influences how they take photos. They believe their work shows the true way things are, not just as pretty art. Their promise to show the truth gives their way of telling stories with pictures a special and real point of view. Their photo collections are more than just pictures—they show real life and feelings, as seen through their committed work."
"This method of pumping heat from one place to another served mankind well when refrigerators' main jobs were preserving food and, as air conditioners, cooling buildings.","The really good method of moving heat around has been a big help to people, especially for keeping food fresh longer, reducing spoiled food, and making us healthier. Air cooling systems have also gotten better because of this, making inside areas nice and cool, which helps people work better in hot places. These improvements are now very important for the way we live today, helping lots of different jobs and making our daily lives more comfortable."
"They are based on a robust and effective idea--draw heat from the thing you want to cool by evaporating a liquid next to it, and then dump that heat by pumping the vapour elsewhere and condensing it.","Cooling systems work on a smart and helpful rule. They make something cold by turning a special liquid into a gas fast, which takes away warmth. The gas, with the warmth, is then pushed and turned back into a liquid in a different place. This turning into gas and back into liquid keeps the cold going strong, which is very important for making food stay good and controlling how warm or cold buildings are."
One set of candidates are known as paraelectric materials.,"Paraelectric materials can change their electric charge alignment back and forth without needing an outside electric force. They have a strong ability to store electric energy, and this ability varies with heat, which is good for adjustable energy storage devices and detecting devices. If you put an outside electric force on them, they can change into ferroelectric materials, which means they can be used in more electronic devices. Also, they can bend light in special ways that are not straight, which is great for use in high-tech light-based communication tools. So, working on and making better paraelectric materials is a hopeful area for tech advancements."
"An array of tiny pieces of paraelectric material can sense the heat radiated by, for example, a person, and the pattern of the array's electrical outputs can then be used to construct an image.","A tiny, easily affected group of special materials can sense very weak warmth from a person and make a complex electric signal pattern. People who know a lot about this study the pattern to make a clear heat picture. This tool is very useful for safety, checking health, and watching over nature because it can notice very small changes in how hot or cold something is. This helps to find sickness early and to locate people in saving missions. The information it gives right away can make the systems we use now work better and be more dependable."
"One consequence of Moore's Law, which describes the doubling of the number of transistors on a chip every 18 months, is that the amount of heat produced doubles as well.","Moore's Law says that every one and a half years, the tiny parts (transistors) on a computer brain (chip) will double. This means the computer brain gets hotter faster. Engineers have to come up with ways to cool it down that don't make it work less well or cost too much. As we make these computer brains tinier, figuring out how to keep them cool is super important. If we want our future gadgets to work well and last long, we need to solve this heating problem."
"And the idea of shifting from single-core processors to systems that divided processing power between first two, and then four, subunits, in order to spread the thermal load, also seems to have the end of the road in sight.","Moving from computers with one brain to ones with many brains was first done to handle heat better, but now we're almost at the point where we can't make it better. This makes people look for other ways to make computers faster and better at doing their jobs. Now, we have ways to make computers do many things at once, which makes them work faster and better. As computers get smarter and learn on their own, we need even more powerful computer brains, like GPUs and TPUs, made just for really hard jobs. What computers will be able to do in the future will rely on how strong their brains are and how cleverly we build them and the programs they use."
"The trick to a good thermoelectric material is a crystal structure in which electrons can flow freely, but the path of phonons--heat-carrying vibrations that are larger than electrons--is constantly interrupted. In practice, this trick is hard to pull off, and thermoelectric materials are thus less efficient than paraelectric ones (or, at least, than those examined by Dr Mischenko).","Making a really good heat-to-electricity material means building a solid shape that lets tiny bits of matter called electrons go wherever they want easily, while at the same time messing up the way bigger heat bits, called phonons, move around. It's hard to get this just right, which is why these heat-to-electricity materials aren't as good as another kind called paraelectric materials, which a smart person named Dr. Mischenko is looking into. People who study and try to figure things out are trying really hard to get past these tough problems and make the most out of these heat-to-electricity materials."
"Shy of competition, eager for artificially high prices, they are helping to block the efficient generation, transmission and distribution of energy on the continent.","They are shy about tough rivalry but eager for high costs, so they're not only benefiting from what's happening but also stopping better energy movement in Europe. This stops a better energy trade from happening, maybe making prices higher for everyone and delaying the change to eco-friendly energy."
"Companies that dominate national markets have, so far, had little interest in improving the interconnections which would mean lower prices for consumers across the continent.","These powerful companies don't really care about making the links between systems better, which has made things expensive for people who buy stuff. If these links were better, it could lead to more companies trying to be the best by lowering prices everywhere in the big land area made up of many countries. It's a big deal for everyone involved to understand how these changes could be good for both shoppers and the market as a whole in the long run."
"The European Commission, which on the same day presented its recommendation for improving EU energy policy, also wants to see the unbundling of ownership, the legal separation of energy suppliers and transporters, something that the integrated energy companies and interested governments, notably in France and Germany, are bound to oppose ferociously.","On a very important day, the European Union's rule-making group suggested a well-explained idea to make the EU's energy rules better. They stressed that energy sellers and the companies that move energy should be completely separate. This new idea might not be liked by big energy businesses and some countries, like France and Germany. The rule-making group really wants to change the energy market, and this could lead to a big disagreement. It shows how hard it is to get every country to agree with the EU's big goals."
The risk is that concerns about security of supply may be used spuriously by those in Europe who oppose the sort of liberalisation encouraged by Ms Kroes.,"Some people in Europe might say they're worried about not having steady energy as a reason to fight against the common practice of making the market more open, which Ms. Kroes wants. They might want to make rules that favor their own country, saying it's for the country's good, but these rules could actually hurt the chance for new ideas and fair business fights, which are important for Ms. Kroes's plan to make a lively, free market. It's key to balance having a dependable energy source with encouraging the kind of openness that can make the economy better and give shoppers advantages like more choices and cheaper prices."
"Protection has been tried for long enough and evidently has not worked for the internal market, nor have these companies secured the best deals for consumers from the Russians.","Despite trying very hard and carefully to keep the market safe for a long time, it didn't work to protect the market's own interests. This way of doing things also had the opposite effect, stopping businesses from getting the best offers for buyers when dealing with Russian companies. Because of this, people are starting to think differently about welcoming a market that is more open and where everyone tries to be the best, which could be good for everyone who is part of it."
"All that is laudable enough, but will also require political horse-trading as governments Europe's leaders are due to meet in March to discuss the various energy proposals try to avoid commitments that may hurt domestic energy companies or make European firms less competitive than rivals in America, Asia and elsewhere.","Europe's bosses are getting ready for a tough job in March. They have to find their way through tricky energy plans and talks without hurting local energy businesses. They also have to make sure European businesses can keep up with powerful rivals from America, Asia, and other places. The big meeting is very important because it needs a thoughtful mix of caring for the environment and looking after money matters."
"Achieving either target would mean promoting cleaner cars, a more effective emissions-trading system for Europe, wider use of public transport and a sharp increase in the use of renewable sources of energy, like wind and solar power.","We need to put first things first and push for the use of vehicles that don't pollute as much. Also, Europe has to make its system for swapping pollution permits better. It's important to get more people to use buses and trains to reduce the number of cars being used. Plus, we should really depend more on energy that comes back, like from the sun and wind. If we do all these things, we can work against the warming of our planet and make sure we can keep living well without running out of resources."
"If successful, virus therapy could eventually form a third pillar alongside radiotherapy and chemotherapy in the standard arsenal against cancer, while avoiding some of the debilitating side-effects.","New, creative treatments using viruses might change cancer care in a big way, offering a third choice next to radiation and drug treatments. This fresh way of fighting cancer could skip the harsh bad reactions that old-style treatments usually bring. It offers hope for a more focused way to fight cancer that could make treatments work better and make patients feel better. If we mix this virus treatment with the ones we already have, it could transform the study and treatment of cancer by giving patients care that's more tailored to them and doesn't involve surgery."
Cancer-killing viruses exploit the fact that cancer cells suppress the body's local immune system.,"Viruses that fight cancer, called oncolytic viruses, are smartly made to go after cancer cells, which often make the nearby immune defenses less strong. These viruses can get into cancer cells and break them down while leaving normal cells alone, so they don't hurt healthy parts of the body much. Also, they can start an immune attack on the cancer, making their healing effect better. This approach of both hitting cancer cells straight on and also boosting the immune system in a roundabout way highlights the advanced promise of using viruses to treat cancer."
"Prof Seymour's innovative solution is to mask the virus from the body's immune system, effectively allowing the viruses to do what chemotherapy drugs do - spread through the blood and reach tumours wherever they are.","Professor Seymour made a new, game-changing treatment that smartly hides the virus from the body's defense system, similar to how strong cancer-fighting medicines work. The virus can then travel hidden in the blood and hit cancer cells wherever they may be. This new way aims at harmful growths really well and might save the patient's good body parts from harm."
"After the stealth virus infects the tumour, it replicates, but the copies do not have the chemical modifications.","When a sneaky virus made to attack cancer gets into a lump of abnormal cells, it grows in number fast. However, the new viruses it makes don't have the same special stuff that the first virus did. This makes experts curious about whether the virus will continue to be effective in the long run. To figure this out, people who study and experiment are looking into how the virus changes when it grows. They aim to ensure it stays good at fighting cancer, turning it into a stronger tool to combat the illness."
"Two viruses are likely to be examined in the first clinical trials: adenovirus, which normally causes a cold-like illness, and vaccinia, which causes cowpox and is also used in the vaccine against smallpox.","Scientists are getting ready to closely examine two viruses in future medical tests. They want to look into the ordinary adenovirus, which often gives people mild cold signs, to learn more about it and maybe use it to give vaccines. Also, they will study the vaccinia virus, which is linked to cowpox and was important in making the smallpox shot that worked well. This study is trying to learn more about both not-so-serious and very important viruses from the past, which could lead to new ways to treat and prevent spreading sicknesses."
"For years European economies had been lagging dismally behind America (to say nothing of Asia), but in 2006 the large continental economies had one of their best years for a decade, briefly outstripping America in terms of growth.","For many years, Europe's big economies weren't doing as well as the powerful economy of America or the quickly expanding economies in Asia. But in 2006, something big changed for Europe, and they had their best year in ten years. This quick and impressive change for the better even did better than the growth in the United States for a short time, causing a lot of hope and happiness all over Europe. The people who make rules and the people who put money into businesses began to think that Europe might keep doing well and, after a while, do even better than other economies around the world."
"Every four or five years, European countries take a large stride towards further integration by signing a new treaty: the Maastricht treaty in 1992, the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, the Treaty of Nice in 2001.","About every four to five years, countries in Europe take a big step to work more closely together by agreeing on a new agreement. For instance, in 1992, the Maastricht Agreement was a big deal because it created the European Union and started using the euro as money. Then, in 1997, the Amsterdam Agreement made the EU's organizations more powerful and made things work more easily. Next, the Nice Agreement in 2001 got the EU ready to let new countries from the east join. These agreements demonstrate Europe's continuous work to come together and expand."
"And in 2005 they were supposed to ratify a European constitution, laying the ground for yet more integration until the calm rhythm was rudely shattered by French and Dutch voters.","In 2005, the European Union was close to accepting a big set of rules that would make the countries work more closely together, creating stronger togetherness. But this forward movement stopped quickly when people from France and the Netherlands voted no to the rules in a surprising turn of events. This no vote was like a big wave of surprise across Europe and made the bosses think again about how to bring the countries together, considering the different thoughts of the people living there."
"Government leaders have already agreed to celebrate it ceremoniously, restating their commitment to 'ever closer union' and the basic ideals of European unity.","All the government bosses agreed together to have a big party, making their promise to work closely together even stronger. They want to show how much they care about sticking together as Europe. This party is a sign of everyone supporting each other and helps everyone remember that they are all walking the same road towards a future where they are joined together."
But it does not take a Machiavelli to spot that once governments have signed the declaration (and it seems unlikely anyone would be so uncollegiate as to veto it) they will already be halfway towards committing themselves to a new treaty.,"Signing the declaration is more than just for show; it's an important action that shows a promise based on what's right, even if it's not yet required by law. When nations put their signature on the paper, they're not just showing they're together—they're getting ready for future duties. Putting your name on the declaration suggests that each country knows they're expected to stick to the upcoming deal, setting a rule that would be tough to get out of without causing problems between countries. At its core, the simple act of signing is a quiet yet powerful move that nudges the whole world closer to a deal that will be difficult to reverse once it starts."
"Neoclassical economics is built on the assumption that humans are rational beings who have a clear idea of their best interests and strive to extract maximum benefit (or 'utility', in economist-speak) from any situation.","People don't always make smart choices because their thinking can be off and their feelings can get in the way, which is different from what old-school economic theories would expect. Herbert Simon said that people just try to find a good enough answer, not the perfect one, because their brains can only handle so much, and there are always things getting in the way. What people do with their money can be shaped a lot by what's normal in their society and what they've grown up with, which might not make sense to old-fashioned economics but does make sense when you look at it differently. These new ideas have led to new ways of thinking about economics that include how people think and feel. By realizing that old ways of thinking about economics don't cover everything, there's a move towards a deeper way of looking at economics that takes into account all the different things that can change how people make choices, leading to a bigger picture that fits better with how people actually are."
"According to the German government which holds the EU's agenda-setting presidency during the first half of 2007, there will be a new draft of a slimmed-down constitution ready by the middle of the year, perhaps to put to voters, perhaps not.","In the early part of 2007, Germany is in charge of the European Union and is making a shorter, clearer version of the EU's main rules. They want to finish it by the middle of the year and maybe people will vote on it, but that's not sure yet. Germany is really focused on making the EU's important papers better to help the EU work better and be more fair in how it makes decisions. But this job is made tough because the EU is complex and each country in it wants different things, so no one knows how it will turn out."
"Then, according to bureaucratic planners in Brussels and Berlin, blithely ignoring the possibility of public rejection, the whole thing will be signed, sealed and a new constitution delivered in 2009-10.","The careful organizers in Brussels and Berlin believe the detailed deal will be agreed upon and finalized soon, resulting in a new set of rules by 2009-10. But they might be too hopeful, because big political plans often run into sudden hold-ups and problems, and they could be guessing too low about the possibility of people strongly disagreeing."
"UK and Australian health agencies have released information about 240 cases of odd occurrences, including sleepwalking, amnesia and hallucinations among people taking the drug zolpidem.","After worrying news about the sleep medicine zolpidem, health groups in the UK and Australia are looking into it carefully and talking to medical workers about telling people about the risks of this medicine. They have told doctors to think hard before giving zolpidem to people, especially if they have had mental health problems or misused drugs before. Information from patients who have had side effects is being collected to learn more about what the medicine does. The health groups might make the rules for using zolpidem stricter, make sure doctors are more careful about who they give it to, check patients better before giving it to them, and watch more closely over how it's used. They want to make sure the good things about zolpidem are more important than the bad things, and they promise to keep telling people about what they find out."
"While doctors say that zolpidem can offer much-needed relief for people with sleep disorders, they caution that these newly reported cases should prompt a closer look at its possible side effects.","Doctors know that zolpidem can really help people who have a hard time sleeping, but they also tell people to be careful because it can have bad side effects. They're trying to figure out the best way to give it to patients. It can make a big difference for people who always have trouble sleeping, but doctors have to be very careful, check on patients a lot, and think hard about whether to give it to them. They suggest using zolpidem in a smart way, making sure the patient is safe first, and maybe even doing more checks and studies on how it works over a long time."
"The newly reported cases in the UK and Australia add to a growing list of bizarre sleepwalking episodes linked to the drug in other countries, including reports of people sleep-driving while on the medication.","People in the UK and Australia have been walking in their sleep and doing risky things, like driving while asleep, because of a medicine. This shows that we need to know more about the dangers and maybe make stricter laws about doctors giving out and people taking powerful calming drugs."
The drug is a benzodiazepine-like hypnotic that promotes deep sleep by interacting with brain receptors for a chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid.,"This strong medicine, like some calming drugs, aims to cause deep, healing sleep by focusing on special spots in the brain that are important for the work of GABA, a substance that slows down brain activity. By boosting GABA's soothing power, the medicine assists people with sleep problems to get a better and more peaceful sleep, making their sleep habits better and their total sleep better."
"The product information for prescribers advises that psychiatric adverse effects, including hallucinations, sleepwalking and nightmares, are more likely in the elderly, and treatment should be stopped if they occur.","Doctors who give out medicine are told to be careful because older people might have more mental health problems like seeing things that aren't there, walking in their sleep, and bad dreams when they take some medicines. If these signs show up, it's very important to stop the medicine right away. Doctors should keep a close eye on their older patients for these problems and do something fast if they see them. It's key for doctors to talk clearly and honestly with patients and their families to deal with any problems fast and stop any hurt."
Patient advocacy groups say they would like government health agencies and drug companies to take a closer look at the possible risks associated with sleep medicines.,"Groups that support patients are pushing for more attention to the dangers of sleep drugs from government health offices and the companies that make these drugs. They emphasize the importance of sharing clear results from medical tests to help people make smart choices about their health. These groups think that more careful supervision could lead to treatments that work better and are safer, which would be better for everyone's health. They are calling for health rule-makers, companies that create drugs, and medical workers to put the well-being of patients first."
"Millions of people have taken the drug without experiencing any strange side effects, points out Richard Millman at Brown Medical School, director of the Sleep Disorders Center of Lifespan Hospitals in Providence, Rhode Island, US.","Lots of people have used this medicine and haven't had any odd or troubling reactions. Dr. Richard Millman, a well-known teacher at Brown Medical School and the boss of the Sleep Problems Clinic at Lifespan Hospitals in Providence, Rhode Island, says it's safe. He's well-trusted and knows a lot about medicine, which makes us believe more when he says the medicine won't harm people."
"The Guardian has learned that the FSA will launch a series of 10-second television adverts in January telling shoppers how to follow a red, amber and green traffic light labelling system on the front of food packs, which is designed to tackle Britain's obesity epidemic.","The news source, the Guardian, has shown that the food rules group, the FSA, plans to deal with health issues in advance by starting a new project in January. They will begin showing short, 10-second TV commercials to guide people who buy things to pick better food options. These commercials will make it simple to understand the color-coded system of red, yellow, and green signals on food wrappers, which helps people quickly judge if food is good for them. This project is a focused attempt by the FSA to solve the increasing overweight issue in Britain."
"The industry is planning a major marketing campaign for a competing labelling system which avoids colour-coding in favour of information about the percentage of ""guideline daily amounts"" (GDAs) of fat, salt and sugar contained in their products.","The industry is making a new way to show information on food packages with a lot of attention. They are starting a special plan to show how much fat, salt, and sugar is in food every day without using the common color codes. They want to give people easy-to-understand facts to help them pick better foods, which might lead to better eating routines. The goal is to make their food stand out and attract people who like to know a lot about what they eat."
"Sources at the TV regulators are braced for a legal challenge from the industry and have described the lobbying efforts to block any new ad ban or colour-coded labelling as ""the most ferocious we've ever experienced"".","TV rule-makers, who know the industry doesn't like being told what to do, think there will be a big court battle over new limits on ads. They've seen a lot of pressure to stop complete ad stoppages and firm naming of products, making people who want stronger ad laws anxious. The fight between keeping people healthy and letting businesses do what they want is getting more heated, leading to what will probably be a long court fight."
"The FSA is understood to have briefed its ad agency, United, before Christmas, and will aim to air ads that are ""non-confrontational, humorous and factual"" as a counterweight to industry's efforts about the same time.","The FSA told its advertising company, United, about their plans early, before Christmas comes. They got ready so United could make ads that don't start fights, are a little bit funny, and only have true facts. They did this to show what the FSA stands for and to stand out from other companies that are very pushy with their ads when it's time for celebrations. The FSA wants to make sure that among all the mess of ads during the holidays, people really hear and remember their ads."
"Ehrlich's model shows that whilst most of these oscillations cancel each other out, some reinforce one another and become long-lived temperature variations.","Ehrlich's simple explanation of weather patterns shows that even though many of the different flows in the weather balance each other, some join forces and make certain changes more noticeable. When these effects merge, they can cause big and long-term shifts in how hot or cold it gets. This tells us that we need to understand how the parts of the weather work as a team, not just by themselves."
"For example, if sea ice begins to form because of a slight cooling, carbon dioxide that would otherwise have found its way into the atmosphere as part of the carbon cycle is locked into the ice.","When a small drop in temperature causes a lot of sea ice to form, it can capture carbon dioxide that is usually part of the Earth's natural carbon recycling. This might help lessen the warming of the Earth by reducing the trapping of heat. But, this can also be bad for sea life by stopping the normal air and water mixing, which can impact creatures that need carbon dioxide to make their food with sunlight. Also, the ice's ability to bounce back sunlight, called albedo, could make the area even colder, adding to the original drop in temperature. This capturing of carbon dioxide in sea ice can have many different results, which we need to think about when looking at the whole Earth's weather patterns."
"One such cycle describes the way Earth's orbit gradually changes shape from a circle to a slight ellipse and back again roughly every 100,000 years.","Every 100,000 years, the path Earth takes around the Sun changes a bit, which really changes our weather over time. When the path goes from more round to a bit more oval, the Sun's heat reaching Earth isn't always the same, which can cause big weather changes, like ice ages. The pull from big planets like Jupiter and Saturn makes these changes even more complicated. Knowing about these patterns is super important for experts to figure out what the weather was like a long time ago and what it might be like later on."
"However, Edwards believes the small changes in solar heating produced by Milankovitch cycles are then amplified by feedback mechanisms on Earth.","Edwards believes that even tiny changes in the sun's warmth, due to cycles named after Milankovitch, can make the Earth's weather react a lot. He thinks that these small changes can become much bigger because of the way the Earth's weather system works, causing big changes in the weather over time. This means that a little change in the sun's energy can start a chain of events in nature, changing things like ice, plants, and the gases that make the Earth warm. Knowing about these cycles is very important to understand the weather in the past and to guess what the weather will be like in the future. It shows us that even small things from outside can have a big effect on the weather of our world."
