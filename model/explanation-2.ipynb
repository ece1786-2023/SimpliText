The Earth's weather system, which includes loops that can make these shifts stronger or weaker, intensifies these changes. These loops are called feedback loops. They can make the sun's warmth changes more or less powerful, causing big weather changes. For instance, when there's less ice, the sea soaks up more warmth. This soaking up can cause even more ice to melt. Edwards hints that we might not see these changes from the sun right away, but they really do shake up our weather.
