Also, we need to remember that these natural processes include how ice and snow send sunlight back into space, and how frozen ground can release gases that make the Earth warmer, both of which can make global warming worse. So, even tiny starting changes in how Earth moves around the sun can start a series of changes in nature, which in the end lead to big changes in the weather.
