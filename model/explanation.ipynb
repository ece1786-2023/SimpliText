These types can join together to make a bigger difference. They can lead to long times of getting hotter or colder. For instance, El Niño is when the water gets warmer in the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation is another cycle that takes about ten years to go around. If both cycles are making things warmer at the same time, they can make the Pacific Ocean get even hotter.
