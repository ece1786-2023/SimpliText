            "Paraelectric materials are unique substances that inherently lack any spontaneous electric polarization. However, when subjected to the influence of an applied external electric field, these materials can be effectively polarized. Consequently, this property makes them particularly useful in various applications, such as in the manufacturing of capacitors where the ability to store and release electrical energy is crucial. Moreover, due to their responsive nature, paraelectric materials are also employed in sensors and other electronic devices that require a rapid change in polarization in response to external stimuli.\n"
