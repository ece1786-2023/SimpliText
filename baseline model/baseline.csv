"Managing down operating costs within such a complex technology environment is extremely difficult. Retiring applications that are tightly coupled within the technical and data architecture results in nearly insurmountable dependency management issues and change risk. Seemingly small projects quickly become big, expensive efforts with extended timeframes. Retiring one application inevitably requires upstream and downstream changes and this added cost erodes the business case and often leads to a decision to leave things as they are.","Cutting costs in a complicated tech system is very hard. Shutting down programs that are closely linked to the system and data setup causes big problems with dependencies and risks. Small projects often turn into large, costly ones that take a long time. Stopping one program usually means making many other changes, which makes it expensive and often results in deciding not to change anything."
"In this editorial for the collection on complexity in mental health research, we introduce and summarize the inaugural contributions to this collection: a series of theoretical, methodological, and empirical papers that aim to chart a path forward for investigating mental health in all its complexity... From physics to ecology, there is a rapidly evolving body of interdisciplinary research dedicated to investigating complex systems.","In this introduction to the collection on mental health research complexity, we present and overview the first papers in the series. These papers cover theories, methods, and studies, and they seek to guide future research into the intricate nature of mental health. Research on complex systems is growing across various fields, from physics to ecology."
"Throughout the twentieth century, much of psychiatry aspired to reductionist simplicity... However, far from uncovering simple etiologies, the past century of psychiatric research has revealed systematic complexity, leading to a growing recognition that mental disorders are dauntingly complex phenomena.","During the 1900s, psychiatry aimed to find simple explanations for mental health issues. But instead of finding simple causes, research has shown that mental disorders are very complex, and this understanding is increasing."
Impulses travel along nerves at a speed called the nerve conduction velocity (NCV). This velocity has been extensively measured in human peripheral nerves because of its utility in clinical medicine. Appreciably decreased NCV can be an important indicator of nerve injury or disease,"Nerve impulses move at a speed known as nerve conduction velocity (NCV). Doctors have measured this speed a lot in human body nerves because it helps in medical treatment. If the NCV is much lower than normal, it could mean there's nerve damage or illness."
"Social isolation also comes with significant risk of mental health and neuropsychiatric disorders, including chronic anxiety and depression. Alongside this complex aetiology, social isolation has been linked to the increased prevalence of substance use disorders across a range of drug types, where social isolation both predicts drug abuse, and drug abuse occurs as a consequence of social isolation. Unfortunately, when socially isolated individuals wish to moderate or quit drug-intake, quitting is more difficult and less successful, limiting the likelihood of a long lasting recovery","Being alone a lot can lead to mental health problems like ongoing worry and sadness. It can also make people more likely to use and abuse drugs, and this can happen because they're isolated or make them feel more isolated. Sadly, people who are alone and want to stop using drugs often find it harder to quit and stay off drugs for good."
"The mobile nature of digital games ensures that the lines between in-school and out-of-school gameplay is blurred. Thus, it is important to explore the possibilities of these games to create new spaces for learning and engaging with mathematics. From a social learning perspective, research has been concerned with the ways in which the games industry has been influencing ‘interactive’ learning via computers; creating spaces for students to create their own digital games in order to teach concepts to peers; or the ways in which the games are arranged to motivate learners to engage with the games and engage with higher-order problem solving abilities.","Digital games can be played anywhere, mixing school and home play. We should look into how these games can help with learning math. Studies have looked at how game-making by students can teach others, how the gaming industry promotes learning through computers, and how games encourage players to solve complex problems."
"Fritz et al. implement one of the suggestions by Ioannidis et al., using network analysis to study interrelations among psychological and environmental resilience factors for mental health, such as family support and self-esteem, in adolescents with and without child adversity","Fritz and colleagues put into practice a recommendation from Ioannidis and others by applying network analysis to examine how different factors related to mental resilience, like family support and self-esteem, interact in teenagers who have and haven't faced childhood hardships."
"Mental disorders arise from a host of components across biological, psychological, and social levels of analysis, intertwined in a web of complex interactions... We must go further and understand both the individual components and the complex interactions among them","Mental disorders are caused by many factors that are biological, psychological, and social, which all interact in complicated ways. We need to study both these factors and how they interact with each other."
"Ethical considerations are crucial in AI and ML, as their usage presents significant concerns around privacy, accountability, and command. The potential for algorithms to perpetuate existing biases, responsibility for AI-generated decisions, and the misuse of AI and ML for malicious purposes like cyberattacks and misinformation are key ethical concerns","Ethical issues are very important in AI and ML because they raise big worries about privacy, who is responsible, and control. The risk of algorithms continuing current prejudices, who is to blame for decisions made by AI, and the harmful use of AI and ML for things like hacking and spreading false information are major ethical problems."
"In his numerous writings, Marx critiques capitalism by identifying its flaws... Only once the working class realizes the flaws of the system, Marx believes, will they - must they - rise up against their bourgeois masters and achieve the necessary and inevitable communist revolution.","Marx criticizes capitalism and its problems in his writings. He thinks that when workers see these problems, they will rebel against their rich bosses and start a communist revolution."
"To get a better idea of how lice evolved and spread, a team led by marine biologist Marina S. Ascunce of the University of Florida in Gainesville sequenced the genomes of 463 head lice collected from 38 countries. The researchers found that human head lice belong to two genetically distinct clades, or groups, both of which hitched rides to the Americas on humans.","A team led by Marina S. Ascunce from the University of Florida studied the evolution and spread of lice by analyzing the genetic material of 463 head lice from 38 countries. They discovered that there are two different genetic groups of human head lice, both of which traveled to the Americas with humans."
"For the last 10 years, the 'Convention of States' movement has sought to remake the Constitution and force a tea party vision of the framers’ intent upon America. This group wants to wholesale rewrite wide swaths of the U.S. Constitution in one fell swoop. In the process, they hope to do away with regulatory agencies like the FDA and the CDC, virtually eliminate the federal government’s ability to borrow money, and empower state legislatures to override federal law.","For the past decade, the 'Convention of States' movement has aimed to change the Constitution to reflect a strict interpretation of the original founders' ideas. They aim to make major changes to the U.S. Constitution all at once. Their goal is to eliminate agencies such as the FDA and CDC, greatly reduce the federal government's borrowing power, and give state governments the power to overturn federal laws."
"Surgeons have given a man suffering from a debilitating lung condition a new lease of life by using breast implants in an unprecedented procedure. After Davey Bauer from Missouri caught the flu a few months ago, he developed a lung infection that was resistant to antibiotics.","Surgeons used breast implants in a unique operation to improve the life of a man with a severe lung problem. Davey Bauer from Missouri got a lung infection after having the flu, and antibiotics didn't work on it."
"A long-beaked echidna, named after David Attenborough and thought to be extinct, has been rediscovered in the mountains of Indonesia. The long-lost species of mammal is described as having the spines of a hedgehog, the snout of an anteater and the feet of a mole.","A rare echidna with a long beak, named after David Attenborough and once believed to be extinct, was found again in Indonesian mountains. This mammal has hedgehog-like spines, an anteater-like snout, and mole-like feet."
"The emergence of miniature and micro-products and components is increasingly demanding the production of parts with dimensions in the range of a few tens of nanometers to a few millimeters. Micro-/nano-cutting is one of the key technologies to enable the realization of micro-products, while a great many micro-manufacturing processes have been developed.","Smaller products and parts, from tens of nanometers to a few millimeters in size, are becoming more common, requiring advanced manufacturing methods. Micro- and nano-cutting is a crucial technique for making these tiny products, and many specialized manufacturing processes have been created for this purpose."
"Within this structuralist, defense-in-depth approach, safety margins against these scenarios are enforced through conservative regulations of system design and operation, under the creed that the identified worst-case, credible accidents would envelope all credible accidents for what regards the challenges and stresses posed on the system and its protections. The underlying principle has been that if a system is designed to withstand all the worst-case credible accidents, then it is ‘by definition’ protected against any credible accident","This approach focuses on strong safety measures by setting strict rules for designing and running systems. It assumes that if a system can handle the most extreme possible accidents, it will be safe from all other possible accidents."
"A constant failure rate (CFR) is indicative of externally induced failures, as in the constant hazard rate situation for non-repairable items. A CFR is also typical of complex systems subject to repair and overhaul, where different parts exhibit different patterns of failure with time and parts have different ages since repair or replacement. Repairable systems can show a decreasing failure rate (DFR) when reliability is improved by progressive repair, as defective parts which fail relatively early are replaced by good parts. ‘Burn in’ is applied to electronic systems, as well as to parts, for this purpose.","A constant failure rate (CFR) suggests that failures are caused by outside factors and is common for items that can't be fixed. It's also common in complex systems that are repaired often, where parts fail at different times and have been repaired or replaced at different times. Repairable systems might have a decreasing failure rate (DFR) if repairs over time replace faulty parts with good ones, improving overall reliability. ""Burn in"" is a process used for electronics and individual parts to help achieve this."
"It should be noted that, although the system engineering process is applicable in all phases of the life cycle, this is not to imply that any single organizational entity within a given project is responsible for the completion of all of the tasks necessary to accomplish these objectives. The process must be an “inherent” element within any given program structure, and the successful fulfillment of such objectives is dependent on many different organizational groups, working in a cooperative and integrated manner.","The system engineering process is useful in all life cycle phases, but it doesn't mean one team does all the work. The process should be a natural part of the program, and achieving goals requires many teams to work together."
"Thompson and Zhi acknowledge that the AI models are only as good as the data on which they’re trained. There is a lack of racial and geographical diversity in individuals who have had their brains scanned and genomes sequenced, especially in databases such as the UK Biobank, so the findings from this AI-guided research might not be applicable to everyone. Furthermore, Goate says it will be crucial to show that the AI models’ performance can be replicated in other databases, and that they show consistent results.","Thompson and Zhi recognize that AI models depend on the quality of their training data. Due to the limited racial and geographical variety of people in brain scan and genome sequencing databases, like the UK Biobank, the research results using AI may not apply to all populations. Additionally, Goate emphasizes the importance of verifying that AI models work well across different databases and produce reliable outcomes."
"Now recall that the underlying LLM’s task, given the dialogue prompt followed by a piece of user-supplied text, is to generate a continuation that conforms to the distribution of the training data, which are the vast corpus of human-generated text on the Internet. What will such a continuation look like? If the model has generalized well from the training data, the most plausible continuation will be a response to the user that conforms to the expectations we would have of someone who fits the description in the preamble. In other words, the dialogue agent will do its best to role-play the character of a dialogue agent as portrayed in the dialogue prompt.","Remember that the main job of the language model is to create a response that matches what it has learned from a huge amount of text on the Internet after being given a conversation starter and some text from the user. What will this response be like? If the model has learned properly, it will give an answer that seems right for someone acting like the character described at the beginning. This means the dialogue assistant will try to act like the character it's supposed to be, based on the initial conversation prompt."
"Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas. Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.","Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian elections and took over Gaza in 2007, pushing out Fatah, led by President Mahmoud Abbas. Since then, there have been multiple conflicts between Gaza militants and Israel. Israel and Egypt enforce a blockade on Gaza to limit Hamas and prevent attacks, including rocket fire at Israeli cities. Gaza residents argue that Israeli blockades and air strikes are a form of collective punishment."
"If being a spokesman for a generation is a fleeting occupation, being a symbol of an era is downright dangerous for anyone who has the bad luck to outlive it. In the next few years the expatriate Fitzgerald continued to publish stories about flappers and giddy undergraduates in the Saturday Evening Post even as he struggled with alcohol and Zelda's increasingly unstable mental state. Travelling with Zelda in North Africa in 1930, he wrote about hearing ""a dull distant crash which echoed to the farthest wastes of the desert"".","1. Being a representative of a generation is temporary, but becoming an icon of a time period is risky, especially if you live beyond that era.
2. While living abroad, Fitzgerald kept writing stories about young, carefree people for the Saturday Evening Post, even though he was dealing with his own alcohol problems and his wife Zelda's worsening mental health.
3. While in North Africa with Zelda in 1930, he described hearing a faint, echoing noise that reached across the desert."
"This despite the fact that I can say (like everyone else on Harvard’s campus in the fall of 2003) that “I was there” at Facebook’s inception, and remember Facemash and the fuss it caused; also that tiny, exquisite movie star trailed by fan-boys through the snow wherever she went, and the awful snow itself, turning your toes gray, destroying your spirit, bringing a bloodless end to a squirrel on my block: frozen, inanimate, perfect—like the Blaschka glass flowers. Doubtless years from now I will misremember my closeness to Zuckerberg, in the same spirit that everyone in ’60s Liverpool met John Lennon.","Despite being at Harvard in fall 2003 when Facebook started, witnessing Facemash and its controversy, seeing a famous actress followed by fans, and enduring spirit-crushing, toe-graying snow that even froze a squirrel solid, I might later exaggerate my connection to Zuckerberg, just as many claim to have known John Lennon in 1960s Liverpool."
"Rakesh Khurana has amply shown how this delusion of the charismatic savior creates a dysfunctional market for CEOs, allowing the small number of existing public-company CEOs to demand and receive extravagant compensation. The myth of the generalist CEO is bolstered by the many fawning media portrayals where CEOs say that their key jobs are understanding, hiring, and motivating people—leading board members to believe that you can run a technology company without knowing anything about technology.","Rakesh Khurana has clearly demonstrated that the false belief in a heroic CEO leads to an unhealthy market where few CEOs of public companies can ask for and get excessive pay. The idea that a CEO can handle any company is supported by media stories that praise CEOs for focusing on people skills, which convinces board members that industry knowledge, like technology, isn't necessary to lead a tech company."
"At first, it’s a solipsistic fantasy—the secret sharer you can tell your troubles to, or that only you understand. Later, it’s rooted in a more philosophical curiosity, the longing to experience the ineffable interiority of some very different being. My eight-year-old daughter says that she wishes the horses she rides could talk, just so she could ask them what it feels like to be a horse. Such a desire presumes—as Thomas Nagel put it in his 1974 essay “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?”—that animals have some kind of subjectivity, and that it might somehow be plumbed. ","Initially, it's like having an imaginary friend to confide in, someone only you get. Later, it becomes a deeper interest in understanding what it's like to be a completely different creature. My eight-year-old daughter wants to talk to horses to know what being a horse feels like. This wish assumes, as philosopher Thomas Nagel suggested in his essay, that animals have their own perspectives that we could possibly understand."
"I dare say, to deciphering the enigma behind the obsessive, pitch-black fiction. Joseph Heller, the opposite of demonstrative, was given to oblique ways of showing affection….  That was the year Heller published his second novel, “Something Happened,” which Daugherty commends as follows: “Joe stepped beyond Wilson’s sentimentality and Yates’s bitterness to eviscerate modern America’s success ethic.” ","I believe it's about understanding the mystery of very dark and intense stories. Joseph Heller, who wasn't very expressive, showed love in indirect ways. The year he released his second book, ""Something Happened,"" Daugherty praised it by saying: Heller went further than Wilson's emotional style and Yates's harshness to sharply criticize the American ideal of success."
"At a certain point, though—to say exactly when would ruin a fairly stunning surprise—the cat-and-mouse psychology is jettisoned in favor of something more procedural. The two halves of “Love Crime” divide according to the words of the title: the first explores the knotty, feverish, ambiguous bond between Christine and Isabelle, while the second is all about guilt, innocence, evidence and motive. It is interesting and ingenious, even if some of the kinky, queasy fascination that had been so intoxicating in the earlier scenes ebbs away.","At some point, which I won't spoil, the story shifts from a psychological game to a more methodical approach. ""Love Crime"" is split into two parts: the first deals with the complex relationship between Christine and Isabelle, and the second focuses on themes of guilt and innocence. The film is clever and original, although it loses some of the intense, unsettling appeal it had at the beginning."
"If Dickens’s prose fiction has “defects”—excesses of melodrama, sentimentality, contrived plots, and manufactured happy endings—these are the defects of his era, which for all his greatness Dickens had not the rebellious spirit to resist; he was at heart a crowd-pleaser, a theatrical entertainer, with no interest in subverting the conventions of the novel as his great successors D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf would have; nor did he contemplate the subtle and ironic counterminings of human relations in the way of George Eliot and Thomas Hardy, who brought to the English novel an element of nuanced psychological realism not previously explored.","Dickens's writing has flaws like melodrama and predictable endings, but these were common in his time. Unlike later writers like D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf, he didn't challenge traditional storytelling. He also didn't delve into complex character relationships like George Eliot and Thomas Hardy did. Instead, Dickens aimed to entertain the masses."
"F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby by no means serves as a blanket condemnation of the American dream; instead, the author uses the novel and its upwardly mobile protagonist to celebrate the ability of those not born of wealth to rise to the pinnacle of American society while also examining the costs that can accompany such success. When this duality is understood, the book’s descriptions of the glittering banality of the upper-class lifestyle can be seen as a critique of the hollowness of strictly material success, rather than simply demonstrating that Fitzgerald possessed, as Trilling described it, “a taste for aristocracy.”","The Great Gatsby doesn't just criticize the American dream. F. Scott Fitzgerald shows both the positive side of rising from nothing to success and the negative consequences. The novel's portrayal of the empty lives of the rich is a critique of valuing money over everything else, not just Fitzgerald liking the idea of aristocracy."
"For instance, when provided with a pollen-generating food source, bees will develop the capacity to feed on pollen, known as pollinivory; this finding does help to explain the explosion in bee species some 120 million years ago. The study also validates the theory that bees evolved from a species of carnivorous wasps. While pollinivory was confirmed as an important step in the process of bee speciation, the study overturned the previous hypothesis that this factor by itself was the cause of the diversification of bee species.","When bees have access to pollen food, they learn to eat pollen, which helps us understand why there were suddenly many more bee species 120 million years ago. The research also supports the idea that bees came from meat-eating wasps. Although eating pollen was a key part of bees becoming different species, the study showed that it wasn't the only reason for the variety of bee species."
"Though volcanic eruptions emit carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, the atmospheric concentration of this gas is about 16000 times the amount released by volcanic eruptions; therefore, no matter how large a volcanic eruption is, it cannot produce a significant change in the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Further, the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted per year by volcanic eruptions – between 130 and 230 million tons – is roughly equivalent to that emitted in only three to five days of human activity.","Volcanic eruptions release carbon dioxide, but it's a tiny amount compared to what's already in the atmosphere—about 1/16000th. So, even big eruptions don't really affect the overall levels of this gas. Also, the carbon dioxide that volcanoes emit in a whole year is the same amount humans produce in just three to five days."
"Most of Werner's metaphorical moments were painterly - the juxtaposing of the wild bird and the tame tree, the shimmer of the periwinkle, the splurt of titanium white that fell from it onto the pavement. He loved New York for its simple surprises, although in truth, Oregon and Iowa and Arizona and everywhere else had simple surprises as well. Cantaloupe-colored sunrises, banded cows, Dairy Queens, all kinds of things that didn't include black plastic mountains of trash and the smell of dog urine.","Werner often described things in artistic ways, like comparing a wild bird with a calm tree, noticing the sparkle of a blue flower, and the splash of white paint on the ground. He enjoyed the unexpected delights of New York, but he knew that other places like Oregon, Iowa, and Arizona also had their own pleasant surprises, such as colorful sunrises, striped cows, and ice cream shops, which were different from the less pleasant sights and smells of the city."
"The Times, in a welcome but highly uncharacteristic embrace of anarchy, celebrated this development as an ingenious guerrilla tactic in youth's eternal war against adult authority-""a bit of techno-jujitsu,"" as the paper put it. But it's not entirely clear which side is the winner here. When you hear the tone, it apparently sets your teeth on edge, which means that, if the entire class suddenly grimaces, it's a good bet that one of the students just got a text message.","The Times unusually praised this event as a clever trick by young people in their constant rebellion against adults, calling it ""techno-jujitsu."" However, it's not sure who is actually winning. If the sound makes you cringe, then it's likely that a student received a text message when everyone in class makes a face."
"And finally, for most Americans, the War of Imagination - built of nationalistic excitement and ideological hubris and administration pronouncements about ""spreading democracy"" and ""greetings with sweets and flowers,"" and then about ""dead-enders"" and ""turning points,"" and finally about ""staying the course"" and refusing to ""cut and run"" -began, under the pressure of nearly three thousand American dead and perhaps a hundred thousand or more dead Iraqis, to give way to grim reality.","In the end, for many Americans, the initial enthusiasm and pride, along with government claims of promoting democracy and positive expectations, shifted to talk of persistence and not giving up. However, as the death toll rose to nearly 3,000 Americans and possibly over 100,000 Iraqis, the harsh truth started to take hold."
"In the last hundred years intellectual advances of science and politics have in like fashion been crystallized into material of instruction and now resist further change. I would not say that the spirit of teaching is hostile to that of liberal inquiry, but a philosophy which exists largely as something to be taught rather than wholly as something to be reflected upon is conducive to discussion of views held by others rather than to immediate response. Philosophy when taught inevitably magnifies the history of past thought, and leads professional philosophers to approach their subject-matter through its formulation in received systems. ","Over the past century, scientific and political knowledge has solidified into educational content that is resistant to change. While teaching isn't necessarily opposed to open-minded investigation, philosophy that focuses more on being taught than on deep reflection tends to encourage talking about other people's ideas rather than forming one's own. When philosophy is part of a curriculum, it often emphasizes the history of ideas, causing philosophers to engage with their topics through established frameworks."
"It was the preliminary dwarfing and deliquescence of the mature old beside the embryonic mass of the new. It was impossible then—it is, I believe, only beginning to be possible now—to estimate the proportions, possibilities, and inter-relations of the new social orders out of which a social organization has still to be built in the coming years. No formula of definite reconstruction had been evolved, or has even been evolved yet, after a hundred years.","The old was shrinking and dissolving next to the new, which was just starting to form. Back then, it was impossible—and I think it's only starting to become possible now—to understand the size, potential, and connections between the new social structures that we still need to organize in the future. Even after a hundred years, no clear plan for rebuilding has been developed."
"We are never so apt to lose our sense of proportion as when we consider those beloved writers whom we hold to be humourists because they have made us laugh. It may be conceded that, as a people, we have an abiding and somewhat disquieting sense of fun. We are nimble of speech, we are more prone to levity than to seriousness, we are able to recognize a vital truth when it is presented to us under the familiar aspect of a jest, and we habitually allow ourselves certain forms of exaggeration, accepting, perhaps unconsciously, Hazlitt's verdict: ""Lying is a species of wit, and shows spirit and invention.""","We often lose perspective when thinking about our favorite funny writers who make us laugh. We generally love humor and tend to be witty and light-hearted, often preferring jokes over seriousness. We also tend to exaggerate and, as Hazlitt suggests, may see lying as clever and creative."
"The stage in these volumes presents itself indeed not merely as a mirror of life, but as an illustration of the utmost intensity of life, in the fortunes and characters of the players. Ups and downs, generosity, dark fates, the most delicate goodness, have nowhere been more prominent than in the private existence of those devoted to the public mimicry of men and women. Contact with the stage, almost throughout its history, presents itself as a kind of touchstone, to bring out the bizarrerie, the theatrical tricks and contrasts, of the actual world.","The books show that the theater is not just a reflection of real life but also a powerful example of it, especially in the lives and personalities of the actors. The actors' personal lives are full of highs and lows, kindness, tragic destinies, and pure goodness, perhaps more than in other professions. Throughout its history, being involved with the theater has often revealed the oddities, dramatic techniques, and differences of the real world."
"It is this salutary organ of the will of all which establishes, in civil right, the natural equality between men. It is this celestial voice which dictates to each citizen the precepts of public reason, and teaches him to act according to the rules of his own judgment, and not to behave inconsistently with himself. It is with this voice alone that political rulers should speak when they command; for no sooner does one man, setting aside the law, claim to subject another to his private will, than he departs from the state of civil society, and confronts him face to face in the pure state of nature, in which obedience is prescribed solely by necessity.","This essential part of collective will ensures everyone is equal under the law. It's this inner guidance that tells every person how to think and act fairly, without contradiction. Political leaders should only use this guidance when giving orders; if someone ignores the law to control another for personal reasons, they leave behind society's rules and return to a primitive state where force dictates obedience."
"Evolutionary psychology takes as its starting point the uncontroversial assertion that the anatomical and physiological features of the human brain have arisen as a result of adaptations to the demands of the environment over the millennia. However, from this reasonable point of departure, these psychologists make unreasonable extrapolations. They claim that the behavior of contemporary man (in almost all its aspects) is a reflection of features of the brain that acquired their present characteristics during those earliest days of our species when early man struggled to survive and multiply.","Evolutionary psychology begins with the widely accepted idea that the human brain's structure and functions have developed due to environmental challenges over thousands of years. However, these psychologists often make far-fetched claims based on this idea. They argue that almost all of modern human behavior mirrors traits of the brain shaped in the ancient past when early humans fought to live and reproduce."
"In regard to propaganda the early advocates of universal literacy and a free press envisaged only two possibilities: the propaganda might be true, or it might be false. They did not foresee what in fact has happened, above all in our Western capitalist democracies - the development of a vast mass communications industry, concerned in the main neither with the true nor the false, but with the unreal, the more or less totally irrelevant. In a word, they failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions.",The early supporters of widespread education and a free press thought propaganda could only be true or false. They didn't predict the rise of a huge media industry in Western capitalist societies that focuses on irrelevant or unrealistic content. They underestimated people's huge desire for distractions.
"There must therefore be an intrinsic connection between the conditions and the structural adaptations of the organism, and, since the conditions of life cannot be determined by the animal itself, the adaptations must be called forth by the conditions. The selection theory teaches us how this is conceivable, since it enables us to understand that there is a continual production of what is non-purposive as well as of what is purposive, but the purposive alone survives, while the non-purposive perishes in the very act of arising. This is the old wisdom taught long ago by Empedocles.","Organisms must naturally adapt to their environment because they can't control their living conditions; these adaptations are caused by the environment. The theory of natural selection explains that both random and beneficial traits occur, but only the beneficial ones last, as the useless ones die off quickly. This idea goes back to the ancient philosopher Empedocles."
"As their name suggests, rare collectibles are scarce, hard to find items. They can be antiques that are desirable because of their age, type of craftsmanship or some other unique feature that represents the past. Some rare collectibles are so old that they are considered to be antiquities - artifacts of an ancient civilization such as ancient Greek or ancient Chinese society. Alternatively, rare collectibles can be of very recent origin, sometimes being only a few years old. The common denominator of all rare collectibles, no matter what their type or age, is rarity. Frequently, because of their scarcity and their appeal, rare collectibles are also valuable. ","Rare collectibles are scarce items that can be old antiques or newer objects, valued for their age, craftsmanship, or unique features. Some are ancient artifacts, while others are only a few years old. Their main characteristic is their rarity, which often makes them valuable."
"Therefore, though the situation seems dark in the context of the confrontation between the superpowers, the silver lining is provided by amazing phenomenon that the very nations which have spent incalculable resources and energy for the production of deadly weapons are desperately trying to find out how they might never be used. They threaten each other, intimidate each other and go to the brink, but before the total hour arrives they withdraw from the brink.","Even though it looks bad with the superpowers facing off, there's hope because these countries, after spending so much on weapons, are working hard to make sure they're never used. They scare and challenge each other, coming close to conflict, but they always pull back before it's too late."
"Irrespective of how small these differences might be, they are crucial, and the disequilibrium is maintained by air near the surface mixing with air higher up, which is typically appreciably cooler and lower in water vapor content. The turbulence, which takes its energy from the wind mixes the air. As the speed of wind increases, so does the turbulence, and consequently the rate of heat and moisture transfer. We can arrive at a detailed understanding of this phenomenon after further study. The transfer of momentum from wind to water, which occurs when waves are formed is an interacting-and complicated phenomenon.","Even if the differences are small, they are important. The imbalance is kept by surface air mixing with cooler, drier air above. Wind-driven turbulence mixes the air, and more wind means more turbulence and faster heat and moisture exchange. With more research, we can better understand this. The way wind creates waves and transfers energy to water is complex and involves many factors."
"The interconnectedness of brain and body has tantalizing implications for our ability to both understand and treat illness. If some brain conditions start outside the brain, then perhaps therapies for them could also reach in from outside. Treatments that take effect through the digestive system, heart or other organs, for instance, would be much easier and less invasive to administer than those that must cross the blood–brain barrier, the brain’s first line of defence against pathogens and other insults from the body.","The link between the brain and body could help us learn about and cure diseases. If some brain problems begin elsewhere in the body, then treatments might also work from the outside. It would be simpler and less harsh to use treatments that work through the stomach, heart, or other organs than those that have to get past the brain's protective barrier against germs and harm."
"The French are certainly misunderstood: — but whether the fault is theirs, in not sufficiently explaining themselves, or speaking with that exact limitation and precision which one would expect on a point of such importance, and which, moreover, is so likely to be contested by us — or whether the fault may not be altogether on our side, in not understanding their language always so critically as to know “what they would be at” — I shall not decide; but ‘tis evident to me, when they affirm, “That they who have seen Paris, have seen every thing,” they must mean to speak of those who have seen it by day-light.","The French are often misunderstood. It's unclear if this is because they don't explain themselves clearly and precisely, especially on important topics, or if the problem lies with us not fully understanding their language. I won't make a judgment on that, but it's clear to me that when they say, ""Those who have seen Paris, have seen everything,"" they are referring to seeing Paris during the day."
"But it was the figure you cut as an employee, on an employee’s footing with the girls, in work clothes, and being of that tin-tough, creaking, jazzy bazaar of hardware, glassware, chocolate, chicken-feed, jewelry, drygoods, oilcloth, and song hits—that was the big thing; and even being the Atlases of it, under the floor, hearing how the floor bore up under the ambling weight of hundreds, with the fanning, breathing movie organ next door and the rumble descending from the trolleys on Chicago Avenue—the bloody-rinded Saturday gloom of wind-borne ash, and blackened forms of five-storey buildings rising up to a blind Northern dimness from the Christmas blaze of shops.","The important part was how you appeared as a worker, dressed in work clothes and interacting with the female staff, in the lively and diverse marketplace selling everything from hardware to jewelry to music. You were like the strong foundation of it all, feeling the vibrations of people walking above while listening to the neighboring movie theater's organ and the streetcars on Chicago Avenue. All of this took place against the backdrop of a gloomy Saturday with wind-blown ash and dark buildings, contrasting with the bright lights of the stores during the holiday season."
"The streets are paved now, and the telephone and electric companies are cutting down more and more of the shade trees–the water oaks, the maples and locusts and elms–to make room for iron poles bearing clusters of bloated and ghostly and bloodless grapes, and we have a city laundry which makes the rounds on Monday morning, gathering the bundles of clothes into bright-colored, specially-made motor cars: the soiled wearing of a whole week now flees apparitionlike behind alert and irritable electric horns, with a long diminishing noise of rubber and asphalt like tearing silk, and even the Negro women who still take in white people’s washing after the old custom, fetch and deliver it in automobiles.","The streets have been paved, and utility companies are cutting down many trees like water oaks, maples, and elms to install metal poles with wires. There's also a city laundry service that collects laundry in colorful vans on Mondays. The dirty clothes are quickly taken away, accompanied by the sound of car horns and tires on the road. Even the black women who traditionally do laundry for white families now use cars to pick up and deliver the clothes."

"Researchers reasoned that low-frequency sound waves, because they are so well described mathematically and because even small perturbations in emitted sound waves can be detected, could be transmitted through the ocean over many different paths and that the properties of the ocean's interior could be deduced on the basis of how the ocean altered the signals.","Researchers thought that since low-frequency sound waves are well understood mathematically and small changes in them can be noticed, these sounds could travel through the ocean in various ways, and by observing how the ocean changes these sounds, they could learn about the ocean's inside."
"In medical tomography x-rays map the human body's density variations (and hence internal organs); the information from the x-rays, transmitted through the body along many different paths, is recombined to form three-dimensional images of the body's interior.","In medical tomography, x-rays create images of the body's internal structure by measuring density differences. These x-rays pass through the body in various directions, and the data they collect is used to make 3D pictures of the inside of the body."
"Ironically, now that photography is securely established as a fine art, many photographers find it pretentious or irrelevant to label it as such.","Now that photography is widely accepted as a fine art, many photographers think calling it that is unnecessary or unimportant."
"Serious photographers variously claim to be finding, recording, impartially observing, witnessing events, exploring themselves-anything but making works of art.","Serious photographers often say they are discovering, documenting, neutrally watching, or experiencing events, or even examining their own selves, rather than creating art."
"This method of pumping heat from one place to another served mankind well when refrigerators' main jobs were preserving food and, as air conditioners, cooling buildings.",This method of moving heat has been effective for preserving food in refrigerators and cooling buildings with air conditioners.
"They are based on a robust and effective idea--draw heat from the thing you want to cool by evaporating a liquid next to it, and then dump that heat by pumping the vapour elsewhere and condensing it.","They work by using a simple, powerful concept: remove heat from an object by turning a liquid into vapor next to it, then move the vapor to a different location and turn it back into a liquid, releasing the heat."
One set of candidates are known as paraelectric materials.,Paraelectric materials are a type of candidate.

"One consequence of Moore's Law, which describes the doubling of the number of transistors on a chip every 18 months, is that the amount of heat produced doubles as well.","Moore's Law leads to twice as many transistors on a chip every 18 months, causing the heat generated to also double."
"And the idea of shifting from single-core processors to systems that divided processing power between first two, and then four, subunits, in order to spread the thermal load, also seems to have the end of the road in sight.",The concept of moving from single-core processors to systems with two and then four cores to distribute heat appears to be nearing its limit.
"The trick to a good thermoelectric material is a crystal structure in which electrons can flow freely, but the path of phonons--heat-carrying vibrations that are larger than electrons--is constantly interrupted. In practice, this trick is hard to pull off, and thermoelectric materials are thus less efficient than paraelectric ones (or, at least, than those examined by Dr Mischenko).","A good thermoelectric material needs a structure that lets electrons move easily while blocking larger heat vibrations. However, it's difficult to achieve this, making thermoelectric materials generally less efficient than the paraelectric types studied by Dr. Mischenko."

However, large energy companies and some governments, especially in France and Germany, are likely to strongly resist this idea."
The risk is that concerns about security of supply may be used spuriously by those in Europe who oppose the sort of liberalisation encouraged by Ms Kroes.,There is a risk that some people in Europe might falsely use supply security worries to oppose the market liberalization supported by Ms. Kroes.
"Protection has been tried for long enough and evidently has not worked for the internal market, nor have these companies secured the best deals for consumers from the Russians.","Protection has not been effective for the internal market, and companies have failed to get the best deals for consumers from the Russians."
"All that is laudable enough, but will also require political horse-trading as governments Europe's leaders are due to meet in March to discuss the various energy proposals try to avoid commitments that may hurt domestic energy companies or make European firms less competitive than rivals in America, Asia and elsewhere.","The sentence is complex, but it can be simplified as follows:

European leaders will meet in March to discuss energy proposals. They aim to achieve commendable goals but must navigate political bargaining. They want to protect their domestic energy companies and keep European firms competitive with those in America, Asia, and other regions."
